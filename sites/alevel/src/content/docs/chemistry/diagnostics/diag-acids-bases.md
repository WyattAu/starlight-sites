## Acids, Bases and Buffers — Diagnostic Tests

## Unit Tests

### UT-1: Buffer pH Calculation with Dilution

**Question:**

A buffer solution is prepared by adding $0.100\,\text{mol}$ of ethanoic acid
($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$, $K_a = 1.74 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$) and $0.050\,\text{mol}$ of
sodium ethanoate ($\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}$) to water and making up to $250\,\text{cm}^3$.

(a) Calculate the pH of this buffer solution.

(b) The buffer solution is diluted to $500\,\text{cm}^3$ with distilled water. Calculate the new pH
and explain why the pH changes only very slightly.

(c) $10.0\,\text{cm}^3$ of $0.100\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ HCl is added to $90.0\,\text{cm}^3$ of the
original buffer solution. Calculate the new pH.

**Solution:**

(a) Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

$$[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.100}{0.250} = 0.400\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$
$$[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.050}{0.250} = 0.200\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = -\log(1.74 \times 10^{-5}) + \log\frac{0.200}{0.400}$$

$$\text{pH} = 4.759 + \log(0.500) = 4.759 - 0.301 = 4.458$$

Alternatively, using the equilibrium expression:

$$K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} = \frac{[\text{H}^+] \times 0.200}{0.400}$$

$$[\text{H}^+] = \frac{1.74 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.400}{0.200} = 3.48 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = -\log(3.48 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.459$$

(b) After dilution to $500\,\text{cm}^3$:

$$[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.100}{0.500} = 0.200\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$
$$[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.050}{0.500} = 0.100\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$[\text{H}^+] = \frac{1.74 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.200}{0.100} = 3.48 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = 4.459$$

The pH is **unchanged** because both the acid and conjugate base concentrations are halved by
dilution, so their ratio remains the same. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows pH depends only
on the ratio $[\text{A}^-]/[\text{HA}]$Which is unaffected by dilution.

(c) Moles in $90.0\,\text{cm}^3$ of buffer:

$$n(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}) = 0.400 \times 0.0900 = 0.0360\,\text{mol}$$
$$n(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-) = 0.200 \times 0.0900 = 0.0180\,\text{mol}$$

Moles of HCl added: $0.100 \times 0.0100 = 0.00100\,\text{mol}$

HCl reacts with the conjugate base:
$\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}^+ \to \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$

New moles:

- $n(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}) = 0.0360 + 0.00100 = 0.0370\,\text{mol}$
- $n(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-) = 0.0180 - 0.00100 = 0.0170\,\text{mol}$

Total volume: $90.0 + 10.0 = 100.0\,\text{cm}^3 = 0.100\,\text{dm}^3$

$$[\text{H}^+] = \frac{1.74 \times 10^{-5} \times (0.0170/0.100)}{(0.0370/0.100)} = \frac{1.74 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.170}{0.370} = 7.99 \times 10^{-6}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = -\log(7.99 \times 10^{-6}) = 5.10$$

The pH changed from $4.46$ to $5.10$ (only 0.64 units) despite adding a strong acid. If the same
amount of HCl were added to $90\,\text{cm}^3$ of pure water, the pH would be
$-\log(0.00100/0.100) = 1.00$.

### UT-2: Ka from pH and Titration Curve Analysis

**Question:**

(a) A $0.150\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ solution of a weak acid HA has a pH of $2.85$. Calculate $K_a$ for
this acid.

(b) In a titration of $25.0\,\text{cm}^3$ of $0.100\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ HA with
$0.100\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ NaOH, the pH at the half-equivalence point is $3.75$. Calculate $K_a$
and explain why the half-equivalence point gives $K_a$ directly.

(c) Choose a suitable indicator for this titration and explain your choice.

**Solution:**

(a)

$$[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-2.85} = 1.413 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^2}{[\text{HA}] - [\text{H}^+]} = \frac{(1.413 \times 10^{-3})^2}{0.150 - 1.413 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{1.997 \times 10^{-6}}{0.1486} = 1.34 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

(b) At the half-equivalence point, exactly half the weak acid has been neutralised, so
$[\text{HA}] = [\text{A}^-]$. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives:

$$\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \text{p}K_a + \log 1 = \text{p}K_a$$

So $\text{p}K_a = 3.75$ and:

$$K_a = 10^{-3.75} = 1.78 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

(c) For a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH at the equivalence point is alkaline (greater than
7, because the salt of a weak acid and strong base hydrolyses to produce $\text{OH}^-$). A suitable
indicator must change colour in the alkaline range. **Phenolphthalein** is suitable (colour change
at pH 8.3--10.0), as its range falls within the steep portion of the titration curve at the
equivalence point.

Methyl orange would **not** be suitable (colour change at pH 3.1--4.4) because it would change
colour well before the equivalence point.

### UT-3: Kw and pH at Different Temperatures

**Question:**

At $50\,^\circ\text{C}$, $K_w = 5.48 \times 10^{-14}\,\text{mol}^2\text{ dm}^{-6}$.

(a) Calculate the pH of pure water at $50\,^\circ\text{C}$.

(b) Calculate the pH of a $0.0100\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ solution of NaOH at $50\,^\circ\text{C}$.

(c) A student states that a pH of 7 at $50\,^\circ\text{C}$ means the solution is neutral. Evaluate
this statement.

**Solution:**

(a) For pure water, $[\text{H}^+] = [\text{OH}^-]$:

$$[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt{K_w} = \sqrt{5.48 \times 10^{-14}} = 2.341 \times 10^{-7}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = -\log(2.341 \times 10^{-7}) = 6.63$$

Note: The pH of pure water is **less than 7** at $50\,^\circ\text{C}$ because $K_w$ increases with
temperature (the autoionisation of water is endothermic). Despite pH being below 7, the solution is
still neutral because $[\text{H}^+] = [\text{OH}^-]$.

(b)

$$[\text{OH}^-] = 0.0100\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$[\text{H}^+] = \frac{K_w}{[\text{OH}^-]} = \frac{5.48 \times 10^{-14}}{0.0100} = 5.48 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = -\log(5.48 \times 10^{-12}) = 11.26$$

(c) The student"s statement is **incorrect**. At $50\,^\circ\text{C}$A neutral solution has pH
$6.63$ (as calculated in part a). The pH value of 7 is only neutral at $25\,^\circ\text{C}$ (where
$K_w = 1.00 \times 10^{-14}$). Neutrality is defined by $[\text{H}^+] = [\text{OH}^-]$Not by pH
$= 7$. At $50\,^\circ\text{C}$A pH of 7 actually represents a **slightly alkaline** solution because
$[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-7} \lt 2.341 \times 10^{-7} = \sqrt{K_w}$Meaning
$[\text{OH}^-] \gt [\text{H}^+]$.

## Integration Tests

### IT-1: Polyprotic Acid Titration and pH Profile (with Quantitative Chemistry)

**Question:**

Carbonic acid ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$) is a diprotic acid with
$K_{a1} = 4.30 \times 10^{-7}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ and
$K_{a2} = 5.61 \times 10^{-11}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$.

(a) Calculate the pH of a $0.0500\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ solution of carbonic acid.

(b) $25.0\,\text{cm}^3$ of this carbonic acid solution is titrated with $0.100\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$
NaOH. Calculate the pH at the first equivalence point.

(c) Sketch the general shape of the pH titration curve for this diprotic acid, labelling the two
equivalence points and two half-equivalence points.

**Solution:**

(a) Since $K_{a1} \gg K_{a2}$The first dissociation dominates:

$$[\text{H}^+] \approx \sqrt{K_{a1} \times [\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]} = \sqrt{4.30 \times 10^{-7} \times 0.0500} = \sqrt{2.15 \times 10^{-8}} = 1.466 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = -\log(1.466 \times 10^{-4}) = 3.83$$

(b) At the first equivalence point, all $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$ has been converted to
$\text{HCO}_3^-$ (hydrogencarbonate ion). This is an **amphoteric** species that can act as both
acid and base. The pH is given by:

$$\text{pH} = \frac{\text{p}K_{a1} + \text{p}K_{a2}}{2}$$

$$\text{p}K_{a1} = -\log(4.30 \times 10^{-7}) = 6.37$$
$$\text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(5.61 \times 10^{-11}) = 10.25$$

$$\text{pH} = \frac{6.37 + 10.25}{2} = 8.31$$

(c) The titration curve shows:

- Starting pH approximately $3.8$ (weak acid)
- First buffer region (flat) around $\text{pH} = 6.4$ (first half-equivalence point,
  $\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a1}$)
- First equivalence point at approximately $\text{pH} = 8.3$ (less steep than a monoprotic titration
  because $\text{HCO}_3^-$ is amphoteric)
- Second buffer region (flat) around $\text{pH} = 10.3$ (second half-equivalence point,
  $\text{pH} = \text{p}K_{a2}$)
- Second equivalence point at approximately $\text{pH} \gt 10$ (steep portion)
- Final pH approaching that of excess NaOH

### IT-2: Buffer Capacity and Biological Application (with Equilibrium)

**Question:**

Blood is buffered by the carbonic acid-hydrogencarbonate system:

$$\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3(aq) \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+(aq) + \text{HCO}_3^-(aq)$$

Normal blood has $[\text{HCO}_3^-] = 0.0240\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ and $\text{pH} = 7.40$.

(a) Calculate the concentration of $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$ in normal blood.
($K_{a1} = 4.30 \times 10^{-7}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$)

(b) During intense exercise, lactic acid is produced, increasing $[\text{H}^+]$ by
$5.0 \times 10^{-6}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$. Calculate the new pH, assuming the buffer ratio changes
accordingly and $[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]$ increases by the same amount that $[\text{HCO}_3^-]$
decreases.

(c) Explain why this buffer system is effective at maintaining blood pH near 7.4.

**Solution:**

(a) Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

$$7.40 = \text{p}K_a + \log\frac{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]}$$

$$7.40 = 6.37 + \log\frac{0.0240}{[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]}$$

$$1.03 = \log\frac{0.0240}{[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]}$$

$$\frac{0.0240}{[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]} = 10^{1.03} = 10.72$$

$$[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3] = \frac{0.0240}{10.72} = 2.24 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

(b) The added $\text{H}^+$ reacts with $\text{HCO}_3^-$ to form $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$:

$$\text{HCO}_3^- + \text{H}^+ \to \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$$

New concentrations:

- $[\text{HCO}_3^-] = 0.0240 - 5.0 \times 10^{-6} = 0.023995\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$
- $[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3] = 2.24 \times 10^{-3} + 5.0 \times 10^{-6} = 2.245 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$

$$\text{pH} = 6.37 + \log\frac{0.023995}{2.245 \times 10^{-3}} = 6.37 + \log(10.69) = 6.37 + 1.029 = 7.40$$

The pH remains essentially unchanged at 7.40, demonstrating the buffer's effectiveness. Even with
the added acid, the ratio $[\text{HCO}_3^-]/[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]$ barely changes because both
concentrations are much larger than the amount of added $\text{H}^+$.

(c) This buffer is effective because:

1. The $\text{p}K_a$ of carbonic acid ($6.37$) is close to the desired blood pH ($7.40$), meaning
   the buffer operates near its maximum capacity (buffers work best when
   $\text{pH} \approx \text{p}K_a \pm 1$).
2. The concentrations of both components ($\text{HCO}_3^-$ at $0.024\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ and
   $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$ at $2.24 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$) are relatively high, giving
   the buffer a large capacity to absorb added acid or base.
3. The system is linked to the lungs (which remove $\text{CO}_2$ and thus shift the
   $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$ concentration) and the kidneys (which excrete excess $\text{HCO}_3^-$ or
   $\text{H}^+$), providing long-term pH regulation.

### IT-3: Strong Acid-Weak Base Titration with Back-Calculation (with Quantitative Chemistry)

**Question:**

$25.0\,\text{cm}^3$ of a solution of ammonia
($\text{NH}_3$, $K_b = 1.78 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$) is titrated with
$0.0500\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ HCl. The equivalence point is reached at $20.0\,\text{cm}^3$ of HCl.

(a) Calculate the concentration of the ammonia solution.

(b) Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.

(c) Explain why methyl orange is a suitable indicator for this titration but phenolphthalein is not.

**Solution:**

(a) At the equivalence point: $n(\text{HCl}) = n(\text{NH}_3)$

$$n(\text{HCl}) = 0.0500 \times 20.0/1000 = 1.00 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{mol}$$

$$[\text{NH}_3] = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-3}}{25.0/1000} = 0.0400\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

(b) At the equivalence point, the solution contains $\text{NH}_4^+$ (the conjugate acid of
$\text{NH}_3$). This is a weak acid:

$$K_a(\text{NH}_4^+) = \frac{K_w}{K_b(\text{NH}_3)} = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-14}}{1.78 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.618 \times 10^{-10}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

Total volume at equivalence point: $25.0 + 20.0 = 45.0\,\text{cm}^3$

$$[\text{NH}_4^+] = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-3}}{45.0/1000} = 0.02222\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt{K_a \times [\text{NH}_4^+]} = \sqrt{5.618 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02222} = \sqrt{1.248 \times 10^{-11}} = 3.533 \times 10^{-6}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}$$

$$\text{pH} = -\log(3.533 \times 10^{-6}) = 5.45$$

(c) The equivalence point is at pH $5.45$ (acidic), which is in the range of **methyl orange**
(colour change at pH 3.1--4.4... Actually pH 5.45 is slightly above methyl orange's range).

More accurately, methyl red (pH 4.4--6.2) would be the best indicator. However, if the options are
methyl orange (3.1--4.4) and phenolphthalein (8.3--10.0), **methyl orange** is more appropriate
because it is closer to the acidic equivalence point, although neither is perfect. Phenolphthalein
would change colour well before the equivalence point is reached (at pH $\approx 8.3$), giving a
significant endpoint error. Methyl orange at least changes in the acidic region, though the pH at
equivalence (5.45) is slightly above its ideal range. Bromocresol green or methyl red would be the
ideal choice, but methyl orange is the more suitable of the two given options.

**Correction:** The equivalence pH of $5.45$ actually falls within methyl orange's transition if we
consider the gradual colour change. In practice, methyl orange is commonly used for strong acid-weak
base titrations.

### Additional Practice Problems

#### UT-4: Buffer pH After Addition of Acid

**Question:** A buffer solution contains $0.200\,\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}}$ ethanoic acid
($K_a = 1.74 \times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}}$) and $0.100\,\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}}$ sodium
ethanoate. Calculate the pH change when $0.0050\,\mathrm{mol}$ of $\mathrm{HCl}$ is added to
$100\,\mathrm{cm}^3$ of this buffer.

**Solution:**

Initial pH:

$$\text{pH} = \mathrm{p}K_a + \log\frac{[\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO}^-]}{[\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}]} = 4.76 + \log\frac{0.100}{0.200} = 4.76 - 0.301 = 4.46$$
(1 mark)

After adding $\mathrm{HCl}$: $\mathrm{HCl}$ reacts with $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO}^-$ to form
$\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$:

$n(\mathrm{HCl}) = 0.0050\,\mathrm{mol}$

$n(\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO}^-)$ initially $= 0.100 \times 0.100 = 0.0100\,\mathrm{mol}$

$n(\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH})$ initially $= 0.200 \times 0.100 = 0.0200\,\mathrm{mol}$

After reaction:

$n(\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO}^-) = 0.0100 - 0.0050 = 0.0050\,\mathrm{mol}$

$n(\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}) = 0.0200 + 0.0050 = 0.0250\,\mathrm{mol}$

New pH:

$$\text{pH} = 4.76 + \log\frac{0.0050/0.100}{0.0250/0.100} = 4.76 + \log\frac{0.0500}{0.250} = 4.76 + \log(0.200) = 4.76 - 0.699 = 4.06$$
(1 mark)

PH change: $4.06 - 4.46 = -0.40\,\mathrm{pH}$ units.

For comparison, adding the same amount of $\mathrm{HCl}$ to $100\,\mathrm{cm}^3$ of pure water would
give:

$[\mathrm{H}^+] = 0.0050/0.100 = 0.0500\,\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}}$PH $= 1.30$

The buffer limits the pH change to $0.40$ units, compared to a change of $5.70$ units for pure water
(1 mark).

#### UT-5: pH of Salt Solutions

**Question:** Predict whether aqueous solutions of the following salts will be acidic, basic, or
neutral, and calculate the pH where possible:

(a) $\mathrm{NaCl}$ (b) $\mathrm{NH}_4\mathrm{Cl}$ (c) $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COONa}$ (d)
$\mathrm{NaHCO}_3$

**Solution:**

(a) $\mathrm{NaCl}$: $\mathrm{Na}^+$ is the conjugate acid of a strong base ($\mathrm{NaOH}$);
$\mathrm{Cl}^-$ is the conjugate base of a strong acid ($\mathrm{HCl}$). Neither ion hydrolyses.
Solution is **neutral**, pH $= 7$ (1 mark).

(b) $\mathrm{NH}_4\mathrm{Cl}$: $\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ is the conjugate acid of the weak base
$\mathrm{NH}_3$. $\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ hydrolyses:
$\mathrm{NH}_4^+ + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}_3 + \mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{O}^+$.
Solution is **acidic** (1 mark).

(c) $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COONa}$: $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO}^-$ is the conjugate base of the weak
acid $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$. It hydrolyses:
$\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO}^- + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH} + \mathrm{OH}^-$.
Solution is **basic** (1 mark).

(d) $\mathrm{NaHCO}_3$: $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ can act as both an acid and a base (amphoteric). It is
the conjugate base of $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{CO}_3$ (weak acid) and the conjugate acid of
$\mathrm{CO}_3^{2-}$ (weak base). Since $K_a(\mathrm{HCO}_3^-) < K_b(\mathrm{HCO}_3^-)$The basic
character predominates and the solution is **slightly basic**, pH $\approx 8.3$ (1 mark).

## Common Mistakes

**Assuming pH 7 is always neutral:** Neutral means $[\text{H}^+] = [\text{OH}^-]$, not pH 7. At temperatures above $25\,^\circ\text{C}$, $K_w$ increases and the pH of pure water drops below 7, yet the solution is still neutral. At $50\,^\circ\text{C}$, pure water has pH 6.63 but is neutral.

**Forgetting that dilution does not change buffer pH:** When a buffer is diluted, both the acid and conjugate base concentrations decrease by the same factor, so their ratio stays the same. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows pH depends only on the ratio $[\text{A}^-]/[\text{HA}]$, not on the absolute concentrations. Students often calculate a new pH after dilution when there should be none.

**Confusing which species reacts when acid or base is added to a buffer:** When strong acid (HCl) is added, it reacts with the conjugate base component ($\text{A}^-$), not the weak acid. When strong base (NaOH) is added, it reacts with the weak acid component (HA). Getting this backwards leads to the wrong direction of pH change.
