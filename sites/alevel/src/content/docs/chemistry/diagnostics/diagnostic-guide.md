## A-Level Chemistry Diagnostic Guide

## Overview

This diagnostic suite contains 13 topic-level tests for A-Level Chemistry. Each test comprises 3
unit tests (single-topic, maximum difficulty) and 3 integration tests (multi-topic synthesis). The
questions target the hardest material within the A-Level specification and are designed to expose
deep misconceptions.

**Critical dependency notes:**

- Atomic Structure must be mastered before Bonding and Structure.
- Quantitative Chemistry (moles, equations) underpins all subsequent topics.
- Kinetics and Thermodynamics both feed into Equilibrium.
- Acids and Bases requires Equilibrium concepts ($K_a$, $K_w$ as equilibrium constants).
- Electrochemistry draws on redox concepts from Transition Metals and thermodynamics.
- Organic Introduction provides the nomenclature and isomerism foundation for all organic topics.
- Alkanes/Alkenes must precede Halogenoalkanes/Alcohols (mechanism foundations).

## Grading Rubric

### Per-Question Scoring

Each question (unit or integration) is scored on a 0--4 scale:

| Score | Descriptor                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | No meaningful attempt, or fundamental misconception evident  |
| 1     | Correct approach identified but major errors in execution    |
| 2     | Substantially correct method with one significant error      |
| 3     | Correct method, minor arithmetical or notational error       |
| 4     | Fully correct solution with appropriate working and sig figs |

### Diagnostic Classification

For each topic test (6 questions, max 24 marks):

| Total Score | Classification  | Interpretation                                         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22--24      | **Secure**      | Topic fully mastered; ready for extension              |
| 18--21      | **Proficient**  | Sound understanding; minor gaps to address             |
| 13--17      | **Developing**  | Core concepts present but inconsistent application     |
| 8--12       | **Emerging**    | Significant gaps; foundational revision needed         |
| 0--7        | **Not Started** | Major revision required; return to prerequisite topics |

### Unit vs Integration Analysis

- **Unit test score significantly higher than integration score**: Student can apply procedures in
  isolation but struggles with cross-topic synthesis. Focus on mixed-topic practice.
- **Integration test score higher than unit test score**: Unusual but may indicate stronger
  conceptual understanding than procedural fluency. Focus on technique.
- **Both scores low**: Return to prerequisite chain and rebuild from earlier topics.

### Recommended Diagnostic Workflow

1. Begin with `diag-atomic-structure.md`. If score is below 13, revise before proceeding.
2. Work through the Physical Chemistry chain: Atomic Structure, Bonding, Quantitative Chemistry,
   then the parallel branches of Kinetics/Thermodynamics.
3. After completing a topic, attempt its integration tests to check cross-topic fluency.
4. Revisit any topic where the gap between unit and integration scores exceeds 4 marks.
5. Complete the Organic Chemistry chain after Physical Chemistry fundamentals are secure.
6. Transition Metals can be studied alongside the later Physical Chemistry topics.

## Diagnostic Test Matrix

### How to Use the Test Matrix

Each diagnostic test contains questions rated by difficulty and type:

- **UT (Unit Test):** Tests a single concept in isolation. Use these to identify specific gaps in
  understanding.
- **IT (Integration Test):** Combines two or more topics. Use these once unit tests are mastered.

**Self-marking protocol:**

1. Attempt all questions under timed conditions (5 minutes per mark).
2. Mark against the worked solutions.
3. For each incorrect answer, identify whether the error was conceptual (need to re-study the topic)
   or arithmetic (need more practice).
4. Record results in the tracking table below.

### Building a Personal Test Matrix

1. **Baseline assessment:** Take all 13 diagnostic tests without preparation. Record scores.
2. **Identify priority topics:** Sort by score (lowest first). These are your priority topics.
3. **Study cycle:** For each priority topic, study the core content file, then re-take the
   diagnostic test. Repeat until 80%+ is achieved.
4. **Integration phase:** Once all unit test scores are 80%+, focus on integration test questions
   (IT-1, IT-2, IT-3).
5. **Exam simulation:** Select one question from each of 5 different topics and complete them in 25

### Common Error Patterns and Remedies

| Error Pattern                               | Likely Cause           | Remedy                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Correct method, wrong answer                | Arithmetic error       | Slow down; show all working; use a calculator for complex arithmetic  |
| Wrong method, correct steps for that method | Misread the question   | Underline key words; identify what is being asked before starting     |
| Blank answer                                | Knowledge gap          | Return to core content notes; work through relevant worked examples   |
| Partial credit only                         | Incomplete explanation | Practice writing full explanations with all key marking points        |
| Runs out of time                            | Poor time management   | Practice under timed conditions; skip hard questions and return later |
