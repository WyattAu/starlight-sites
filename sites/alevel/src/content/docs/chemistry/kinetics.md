## Chemical Kinetics

Kinetics is the study of reaction rates and the factors that influence them. Thermodynamics tells us
whether a reaction is feasible; kinetics tells us whether it occurs at an observable rate.

## Rate of Reaction

The **rate of reaction** is the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time:

$$
\mathrm{Rate} = \frac{\Delta[\mathrm{product}]}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\Delta[\mathrm{reactant}]}{\Delta t}
$$

The negative sign for reactants ensures a positive rate value. For a general reaction:

$$
A\mathrm{A} + b\mathrm{B} \to c\mathrm{C} + d\mathrm{D}
$$

$$
\mathrm{Rate} = -\frac{1}{a}\frac{d[\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -\frac{1}{b}\frac{d[\mathrm{B}]}{dt} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{d[\mathrm{C}]}{dt} = \frac{1}{d}\frac{d[\mathrm{D}]}{dt}
$$

Units of rate: $\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}$.

### Methods of Measuring Rate

| Method          | Observable                  | Suitable Reactions                                                     |

## Collision Theory

For a reaction to occur between two molecules:

1. **They must collide** with sufficient kinetic energy.
2. The collision must have the correct **orientation** (steric requirement).
3. The kinetic energy along the line of centres must **exceed the activation energy** $E_a$.

### Activation Energy ($E_a$)

The activation energy is the minimum energy that colliding molecules must possess for a reaction to
occur. It represents the energy barrier between reactants and products.

On an **enthalpy profile diagram**, $E_a$ is the difference between the energy of the reactants and
the energy of the transition state (activated complex).

### Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

At a given temperature, the molecules in a gas have a distribution of kinetic energies described by
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:

$$
F(E) = 2\sqrt{\frac{E}{\pi}} \left(\frac{1}{k_BT}\right)^{3/2} e^{-E/k_BT}
$$

Key features:

- The distribution is asymmetric (skewed towards lower energies).
- The most probable energy is at the peak.
- The mean energy is slightly above the most probable energy.
- There is no upper limit on energy, but the fraction of molecules with very high energy decreases
  exponentially.

**Effect of temperature:** Increasing temperature shifts the distribution to higher energies and
broadens it. The proportion of molecules with $E \ge E_a$ increases significantly, even for modest
temperature increases.

**Quantitative analysis:** The fraction of molecules with energy exceeding $E_a$ is approximately
proportional to $e^{-E_a/RT}$. A $10\,\mathrm{K}$ increase from $300\,\mathrm{K}$ to
$310\,\mathrm{K}$ changes the exponent by a factor of $e^{-E_a/R(1/310 - 1/300)}$. For
$E_a = 50\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$:

$$
\mathrm{Ratio} = e^{50000/8.314 \times (1/310 - 1/300)} = e^{-6.45} \approx \mathrm{factor of 2 increase}
$$

This is the origin of the rule of thumb that reaction rates roughly double for every
$10\,\mathrm{K}$ temperature increase.

## Factors Affecting Rate

### Temperature

Increasing temperature increases the rate because more molecules possess kinetic energy exceeding
$E_a$. The effect is exponential (see Arrhenius equation below).

### Concentration / Pressure

Increasing concentration (for solutions) or pressure (for gases) increases the frequency of
collisions. The rate is proportional to the frequency of effective collisions, which increases with
the number of molecules per unit volume.

### Surface Area

Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant increases the number of reaction sites available for
collision, increasing the rate. This is why powders react faster than lumps.

### Catalysts

A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. It does not
alter the thermodynamics (no change to $\Delta H$ or equilibrium position) but increases the rate of
both forward and reverse reactions equally.

On the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, a catalyst effectively shifts the activation energy threshold
to the left, dramatically increasing the fraction of molecules that can react.

## Rate Equations

For a reaction $a\mathrm{A} + b\mathrm{B} \to \mathrm{products}$The **rate equation** has the form:

$$
\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}]^m[\mathrm{B}]^n
$$

Where:

- $k$ is the **rate constant** (temperature-dependent)
- $m$ is the **order of reaction with respect to A**
- $n$ is the **order of reaction with respect to B**
- The **overall order** is $m + n$

**Critical point:** The orders $m$ and $n$ are determined experimentally. They are not necessarily
equal to the stoichiometric coefficients $a$ and $b$. The orders can only be predicted from the
mechanism, not from the overall equation.

### Units of the Rate Constant $k$

The units of $k$ depend on the overall order of reaction:

| Overall order | Rate equation                     | Units of $k$                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0             | $\mathrm{Rate} = k$               | $\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}$   |
| 1             | $\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}]$   | $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$                 |
| 2             | $\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}]^2$ | $\mathrm{mol^{-1}\,dm^3\,s^{-1}}$ |
| 3             | $\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}]^3$ | $\mathrm{mol^{-2}\,dm^6\,s^{-1}}$ |

: $\mathrm{Units of } k = (\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}})^{1-\mathrm{order}} \times \mathrm{s^{-1}}$.

### Integrated Rate Equations

For a **zero-order** reaction ($\mathrm{Rate} = k$):

$$
[\mathrm{A}] = [\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt
$$

A plot of $[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear with gradient $-k$.

For a **first-order** reaction ($\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}]$):

$$
\ln[\mathrm{A}] = \ln[\mathrm{A}]_0 - kt
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
[\mathrm{A}] = [\mathrm{A}]_0 e^{-kt}
$$

A plot of $\ln[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear with gradient $-k$.

The **half-life** of a first-order reaction is:

$$
T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k} = \frac{0.693}{k}
$$

The half-life is constant and independent of initial concentration for first-order reactions.

For a **second-order** reaction ($\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}]^2$):

$$
\frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]} = \frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_0} + kt
$$

A plot of $1/[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear with gradient $k$.

## Determining Orders of Reaction

### Initial Rates Method

Perform experiments with varying initial concentrations while keeping other concentrations constant.
Measure the initial rate for each experiment. Compare rates to determine orders.

**Worked Example.** For the reaction between $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$:

| Experiment | $[\mathrm{A}]$ ($\mathrm{mol/dm}^3$) | $[\mathrm{B}]$ ($\mathrm{mol/dm}^3$) | Initial rate ($\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}$) |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | 0.10                                 | 0.10                                 | $1.2 \times 10^{-3}$                           |
| 2          | 0.20                                 | 0.10                                 | $2.4 \times 10^{-3}$                           |
| 3          | 0.10                                 | 0.20                                 | $4.8 \times 10^{-3}$                           |

Comparing 1 and 2: $[\mathrm{A}]$ doubles, rate doubles. Order with respect to A: $m = 1$.

Comparing 1 and 3: $[\mathrm{B}]$ doubles, rate quadruples. Order with respect to B: $n = 2$.

Rate equation: $\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]^2$. Overall order = 3.

$$
K = \frac{\mathrm{Rate}}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]^2} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-3}}{0.10 \times 0.01} = 1.2\,\mathrm{mol^{-2}\,dm^6\,s^{-1}}
$$

### Continuous Monitoring

Monitor concentration continuously and plot against time. The shape of the curve reveals the order:

- **Zero order:** straight line (constant rate).
- **First order:** exponential decay; $\ln[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear.
- **Second order:** $1/[\mathrm{A}]$ vs $t$ is linear.

## The Arrhenius Equation

The rate constant depends on temperature according to the Arrhenius equation:

$$
K = A e^{-E_a / RT}
$$

Where:

- $A$ is the **pre-exponential factor** (frequency factor) -- related to the frequency of collisions
  and the probability of correct orientation
- $E_a$ is the activation energy ($\mathrm{J/mol}$)
- $R$ is the gas constant ($8.314\,\mathrm{J\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$)
- $T$ is the temperature ($\mathrm{K}$)

Taking natural logarithms:

$$
\ln k = \ln A - \frac{E_a}{RT}
$$

An **Arrhenius plot** of $\ln k$ vs $1/T$ is linear with:

- Gradient $= -E_a / R$
- y-intercept $= \ln A$

This allows determination of $E_a$ from rate constants measured at different temperatures.

**Worked Example.** The rate constant for a reaction is $3.46 \times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ at
$298\,\mathrm{K}$ and $1.50 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ at $350\,\mathrm{K}$. Calculate $E_a$.

$$
\ln k_2 - \ln k_1 = -\frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
$$

$$
\ln\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right) = \frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
$$

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1.50 \times 10^{-3}}{3.46 \times 10^{-5}}\right) = \frac{E_a}{8.314}\left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{350}\right)
$$

$$
\ln(43.35) = \frac{E_a}{8.314}(0.003356 - 0.002857)
$$

$$
3.770 = \frac{E_a}{8.314} \times 4.99 \times 10^{-4}
$$

$$
E_a = \frac{3.770 \times 8.314}{4.99 \times 10^{-4}} = 62,800\,\mathrm{J/mol} = 62.8\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}
$$

## Catalysis

### Heterogeneous Catalysts

The catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants. The mechanism involves adsorption of
reactant molecules onto the catalyst surface, where bonds are weakened, reaction occurs, and
products desorb.

Examples:

- **Haber process:** Iron catalyst; $\mathrm{N}_2$ and $\mathrm{H}_2$ adsorb onto the iron surface,
  the $\mathrm{N}\equiv\mathrm{N}$ triple bond is weakened, and $\mathrm{NH}_3$ forms and desorbs.
- **Contact process:** Vanadium(V) oxide ($\mathrm{V}_2\mathrm{O}_5$) catalyses the oxidation of
  $\mathrm{SO}_2$ to $\mathrm{SO}_3$.

Heterogeneous catalysts can be poisoned by impurities that adsorb strongly to the active sites (e.g.
Lead in catalytic converters, arsenic in the Contact process).

### Homogeneous Catalysts

The catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants. The catalyst forms an intermediate with the
reactants, which then decomposes to release the catalyst and products.

Example: The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalysed by $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions:

$$
\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}^+ \to \mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}
$$

$$
\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \to \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} + \mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}^+
$$

Net: $2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \to 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O}_2$

### Enzyme Catalysis

Enzymes are biological catalysts (globular proteins). They operate by the **lock-and-key** or
**induced-fit** model:

1. Substrate binds to the active site.
2. An enzyme-substrate complex forms.
3. The reaction occurs with lowered $E_a$.
4. Products are released; the enzyme is regenerated.

Enzyme activity depends on temperature (optimum around $37^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for human enzymes;
denaturation above) and pH (each enzyme has an optimum pH).

## Mechanisms and the Rate-Determining Step

The **rate-determining step** (RDS) is the slowest step in a reaction mechanism. It controls the
overall rate. The rate equation reflects the molecularity of the RDS, not the overall stoichiometry.

**Worked Example.** The reaction
$\mathrm{NO}_2(g) + \mathrm{CO}(g) \to \mathrm{NO}(g) + \mathrm{CO}_2(g)$ has the experimental rate
equation $\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{NO}_2]^2$. The proposed mechanism is:

**Step 1 (slow):** $\mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{NO}_2 \to \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{NO}_3$

**Step 2 (fast):** $\mathrm{NO}_3 + \mathrm{CO} \to \mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{CO}_2$

The rate equation depends on the RDS (Step 1): $\mathrm{Rate} = k_1[\mathrm{NO}_2]^2$Consistent with
the experimental rate equation. Note that $\mathrm{CO}$ does not appear in the rate equation because
it is not involved in the RDS.

If a species appears in the rate equation, it must be involved in or before the rate-determining
step. If a reactant does not appear in the rate equation, it must be involved only after the
rate-determining step.

### Pre-Equilibrium Approximation

When a fast reversible step precedes the rate-determining step, the pre-equilibrium approximation
can be used. Consider a mechanism:

**Step 1 (fast, reversible):** $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{X}$ (equilibrium
constant $K$)

**Step 2 (slow, RDS):** $\mathrm{X} + \mathrm{C} \to \mathrm{D}$

Because Step 1 is fast and reversible, it is at equilibrium throughout the reaction:

$$
K = \frac{[\mathrm{X}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]} \implies [\mathrm{X}] = K[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]
$$

The rate is determined by the slow step:

$$
\mathrm{Rate} = k_2[\mathrm{X}][\mathrm{C}] = k_2 K[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}][\mathrm{C}] = k_\mathrm{obs}[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}][\mathrm{C}]
$$

The observed rate constant $k_\mathrm{obs} = k_2 K$ incorporates both the equilibrium constant and
the rate constant of the RDS. The overall order is 3, even though only one step is bimolecular.

### The Steady-State Approximation

For more complex mechanisms, the steady-state approximation assumes that the concentration of any
reactive intermediate remains approximately constant throughout most of the reaction (its rate of
formation equals its rate of consumption).

For an intermediate $\mathrm{X}$:

$$
\frac{d[\mathrm{X}]}{dt} \approx 0
$$

**Worked Example.** Consider the decomposition of $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5$:

$$
2\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5 \to 4\mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{O}_2
$$

Proposed mechanism:

**Step 1:** $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5 \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{NO}_3$ (fast, $k_1$
forward, $k_{-1}$ reverse)

**Step 2:** $\mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{NO}_3 \to \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{NO}_2$ (slow,
$k_2$)

**Step 3:** $\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{NO}_3 \to 2\mathrm{NO}_2$ (fast, $k_3$)

Applying steady-state to $\mathrm{NO}_3$:

$$
\frac{d[\mathrm{NO}_3]}{dt} = k_1[\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5] - k_{-1}[\mathrm{NO}_2][\mathrm{NO}_3] - k_2[\mathrm{NO}_2][\mathrm{NO}_3] - k_3[\mathrm{NO}][\mathrm{NO}_3] = 0
$$

This leads (after simplification) to a rate equation of the form
$\mathrm{Rate} = k_\mathrm{eff}[\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5]$Showing that the reaction is
experimentally first-order, consistent with observation. The key insight is that the intermediate
$\mathrm{NO}_3$ is consumed as fast as it is formed.

### Clock Reactions: The Iodine Clock

The iodine clock reaction is a classic kinetics experiment that demonstrates the initial rates
method in a visually striking way.

**Reaction:** Persulphate ions oxidise iodide ions to iodine:

$$
\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2-}(aq) + 2\mathrm{I}^-(aq) \to 2\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}(aq) + \mathrm{I}_2(aq)
$$

A fixed amount of sodium thiosulphate is added to the mixture. Thiosulphate rapidly reduces any
iodine produced back to iodide:

$$
\mathrm{I}_2(aq) + 2\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_3^{2-}(aq) \to 2\mathrm{I}^-(aq) + \mathrm{S}_4\mathrm{O}_6^{2-}(aq)
$$

Starch indicator is added. As long as thiosulphate remains, the iodine concentration is kept near
zero. Once all the thiosulphate is consumed, the next iodine produced reacts with starch, producing
an intense blue-black colour.

**Analysis:** If the fixed amount of thiosulphate is $n_0$ moles, then the amount of $\mathrm{I}_2$
produced when the colour appears is $\frac{n_0}{2}$ moles, and the amount of
$\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2-}$ reacted is $\frac{n_0}{2}$ moles. The rate is:

$$
\mathrm{Rate} = \frac{n_0 / 2}{t \times V}
$$

Where $t$ is the time for the colour change and $V$ is the total volume. By varying the initial
concentrations of $\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2-}$ and $\mathrm{I}^-$ while keeping the thiosulphate
amount constant, the orders of reaction with respect to each reactant can be determined.

**Worked Example.** In an iodine clock experiment, the following data were obtained at constant
temperature:

| Experiment | $[\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2-}]$ ($\mathrm{mol/dm}^3$) | $[\mathrm{I}^-]$ ($\mathrm{mol/dm}^3$) | Time for colour change (s) |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1          | 0.040                                                   | 0.040                                  | 52                         |
| 2          | 0.080                                                   | 0.040                                  | 26                         |
| 3          | 0.040                                                   | 0.080                                  | 26                         |

Determine the rate equation.

Comparing 1 and 2: $[\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2-}]$ doubles, time halves (rate doubles). Order with
respect to $\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2-}$: $m = 1$.

Comparing 1 and 3: $[\mathrm{I}^-]$ doubles, time halves (rate doubles). Order with respect to
$\mathrm{I}^-$: $n = 1$.

Rate equation: $\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2-}][\mathrm{I}^-]$. Overall order = 2.

### The Effect of a Catalyst on the Arrhenius Plot

Adding a catalyst lowers $E_a$ without changing $A$. On an Arrhenius plot ($\ln k$ vs $1/T$):

- Both the catalysed and uncatalysed reactions have the same y-intercept ($\ln A$).
- The catalysed line has a less steep (less negative) gradient because $E_a$ is smaller.
- The two lines converge as $1/T \to 0$ (as $T \to \infty$).

The ratio of rate constants at a given temperature is:

$$
\frac{k_\mathrm{cat}}{k_\mathrm{uncat}} = e^{(E_{a,\mathrm{uncat}} - E_{a,\mathrm{cat}})/RT}
$$

**Worked Example.** A reaction has $E_a = 75\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ without a catalyst and
$E_a = 50\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ with a catalyst. Calculate the rate enhancement at $298\,\mathrm{K}$.

$$
\frac{k_\mathrm{cat}}{k_\mathrm{uncat}} = e^{(75000 - 50000)/(8.314 \times 298)} = e^{25000/2478} = e^{10.09} = 24,300
$$

The catalyst increases the rate by a factor of approximately 24,000 at room temperature.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Conflating order with stoichiometry.** The orders in the rate equation must be determined
   experimentally. They cannot be read from the balanced equation.

2. **Incorrect units for $k$.** Always derive units from the rate equation. A rate constant with
   incorrect units in an answer will lose marks.

3. **Confusing the activation energy of the forward and reverse reactions.** The activation energy
   of the reverse reaction is $E_a(\mathrm{reverse}) = E_a(\mathrm{forward}) + |\Delta H|$ (for
   exothermic forward reactions).

4. **Assuming catalysts increase yield.** Catalysts increase rate, not yield. The equilibrium
   position is unchanged.

5. **Plotting errors in Arrhenius plots.** The x-axis must be $1/T$ (in $\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), not $T$
   in $^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The gradient is $-E_a/R$ So $E_a = -\mathrm{gradient} \times R$.

6. **Misapplying the steady-state approximation.** The steady-state approximation applies to
   reactive intermediates, not to reactants or products. Intermediates are species that appear in
   the mechanism but not in the overall equation.

7. **Forgetting that clock reactions measure initial rate.** The iodine clock gives the initial rate
   (the rate at $t = 0$). The thiosulphate amount must be small relative to the reactants for this
   to be a good approximation.

8. **Confusing zero-order and first-order half-life behaviour.** For a first-order reaction,
   $t_{1/2}$ is constant (independent of $[\mathrm{A}]_0$). For a zero-order reaction,
   $t_{1/2} = [\mathrm{A}]_0 / (2k)$Which depends on the initial concentration. This is a key
   experimental distinction.

9. **Using the wrong rate expression for gas-phase reactions.** For gas reactions, rate can be
   expressed in terms of concentration change or pressure change. If the question asks for rate in
   terms of pressure, use partial pressures (consistent with $K_p$).

10. **Ignoring the effect of temperature on the pre-exponential factor $A$.** In the Arrhenius
    equation, $A$ is often assumed constant, but it does have a weak temperature dependence. This is
    negligible at A-Level but worth noting.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of molecular speeds (and therefore
kinetic energies) in a gas at a given temperature:

### Key Features

1. The curve is asymmetric, skewed towards higher speeds.
2. The most probable speed is at the peak of the distribution.
3. The mean speed is slightly higher than the most probable speed.
4. The area under the curve represents the total number of molecules (constant).

### Effect of Temperature

At higher temperature:

- The curve flattens and broadens (more molecules have higher speeds).
- The peak shifts to higher speed.
- The area under the curve remains constant.
- A greater proportion of molecules have kinetic energy exceeding the activation energy $E_a$.

### Effect of a Catalyst

A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy ($E_a"$). On the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the $E_a$ line moves to the left, and a larger proportion of
molecules now have sufficient energy to react. The distribution itself does not change.

### Relationship to Collision Theory

For a reaction to occur, two conditions must be met:

1. **Sufficient energy:** The collision energy must exceed the activation energy $E_a$.
2. **Correct orientation:** The molecules must collide with the correct geometry (steric factor).

Only collisions satisfying both criteria lead to reaction. The rate is proportional to the product
of the collision frequency, the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy ($e^{-E_a/RT}$), and
the steric factor.

### Fraction of Molecules with Energy Exceeding $E_a$

The fraction is given by the Boltzmann factor:

$$
F = e^{-E_a/RT}
$$

**Worked Example.** Calculate the fraction of molecules with energy exceeding
$E_a = 50\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ at $298\,\mathrm{K}$ and at $400\,\mathrm{K}$.

At $298\,\mathrm{K}$:

$$
F = \exp\left(\frac{-50000}{8.314 \times 298}\right) = \exp(-20.17) = 1.7 \times 10^{-9}
$$

At $400\,\mathrm{K}$:

$$
F = \exp\left(\frac{-50000}{8.314 \times 400}\right) = \exp(-15.03) = 3.2 \times 10^{-7}
$$

Increasing the temperature from $298\,\mathrm{K}$ to $400\,\mathrm{K}$ increases the fraction of
reactive molecules by a factor of approximately 190, even though the temperature increased by only
34\%. This exponential temperature dependence explains why small temperature changes can have large
effects on reaction rate.

## Enzyme Kinetics (Brief Introduction)

Enzymes are biological catalysts (proteins) that follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics:

$$
V = \frac{V_{\max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}
$$

Where $V_{\max}$ is the maximum rate (when all enzyme active sites are occupied), $[S]$ is the
substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant (substrate concentration at half
$V_{\max}$).

- At low $[S] \ll K_m$: $v \approx \frac{V_{\max}}{K_m}[S]$ -- rate is approximately
  first-order in $[S]$.
- At high $[S] \gg K_m$: $v \approx V_{\max}$ -- rate is approximately zero-order in $[S]$ (enzyme
  is saturated).

This is directly analogous to the behaviour of heterogeneous catalysts at low and high reactant
concentrations.

## Advanced Rate Determination Methods

### The Initial Rates Method: Practical Considerations

When performing initial rate experiments:

1. **Keep initial concentrations of all but one reactant in large excess.** This ensures that the
   concentration of the excess reactant remains essentially constant, and the observed rate depends
   only on the reactant being varied.

2. **Measure the rate before more than 10% reaction has occurred.** This ensures the concentration
   is close to the initial value.

3. **Repeat experiments.** Initial rate measurements are inherently less precise than continuous
   monitoring because they use only two data points (the starting concentration and the amount
   reacted in a short time). Multiple repeats improve precision.

### Continuous Monitoring Methods

**Gas syringe method:** Collect gas produced in a gas syringe and plot volume vs time. The gradient
of the tangent at $t = 0$ gives the initial rate.

**Colorimetric method:** For reactions involving a coloured species, measure absorbance vs time
using a colorimeter. The Beer-Lambert law ($A = \varepsilon cl$) relates absorbance to
concentration.

**Conductivity method:** For reactions that change the number or type of ions in solution, measure
conductivity vs time. For example, the hydrolysis of a halogenoalkane:

$$
\mathrm{R-Br} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \to \mathrm{R-OH} + \mathrm{H}^+ + \mathrm{Br}^-
$$

Conductivity increases as $\mathrm{H}^+$ and $\mathrm{Br}^-$ are produced.

### Determining the Order from Concentration-Time Graphs

| Order | Plot of [A] vs t                  | Linearised plot | Half-life behaviour   |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| 0     | Straight line (negative gradient) | [A] vs t        | Decreases with [A]\_0 |
| 1     | Exponential decay                 | ln[A] vs t      | Constant              |
| 2     | Curved, steeper at start          | 1/[A] vs t      | Decreases with [A]\_0 |

To determine the order experimentally: plot the data in all three linearised forms. The one that
gives the best straight line (highest $R^2$ value) indicates the order.

### Worked Example: Determining Order from Graphical Data

The hydrolysis of a halogenoalkane $\mathrm{R-X}$ was monitored by measuring conductivity. The
following data were obtained:

| Time (s) | Conductivity ($\mu\mathrm{S/cm}$) |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0        | 12.0                              |
| 60       | 25.8                              |
| 120      | 36.4                              |
| 180      | 44.2                              |
| 240      | 49.8                              |
| $\infty$ | 64.0                              |

The conductivity at $t = \infty$ (complete reaction) is $64.0$. The conductivity is proportional to
the concentration of product.

$[\mathrm{P}] \propto (\kappa_t - \kappa_0) = (\kappa_t - 12.0)$ And
$[\mathrm{R-X}] \propto (\kappa_\infty - \kappa_t) = (64.0 - \kappa_t)$.

| Time (s) | $[\mathrm{R-X}]$ (arb. Units) | $\ln[\mathrm{R-X}]$ | $1/[\mathrm{R-X}]$ |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0        | 52.0                          | 3.951               | 0.0192             |
| 60       | 38.2                          | 3.643               | 0.0262             |
| 120      | 27.6                          | 3.318               | 0.0362             |
| 180      | 19.8                          | 2.986               | 0.0505             |
| 240      | 14.2                          | 2.653               | 0.0704             |

Plotting $\ln[\mathrm{R-X}]$ vs $t$: the points (0, 3.951), (60, 3.643), (120, 3.318), (180, 2.986),
(240, 2.653) give an approximately straight line. The gradient is approximately
$-0.0054\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ So $k \approx 0.0054\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and the reaction is first-order
with respect to $\mathrm{R-X}$.

The rate equation for the reaction $\mathrm{A} + 2\mathrm{B} \to \mathrm{C}$ is
$\mathrm{Rate} = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$. Deduce a possible two-step mechanism.

**Solution:**

Since $[\mathrm{B}]$ appears to the first power (not second), the RDS involves one molecule of B,
not two. A possible mechanism:

Step 1 (slow, RDS): $\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \to \mathrm{X}$ (intermediate)

Step 2 (fast): $\mathrm{X} + \mathrm{B} \to \mathrm{C}$

Rate equation: $\mathrm{Rate} = k_1[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$Which matches.

For 90% consumption: $[\mathrm{A}] = 0.10[\mathrm{A}]_0$.

$$

$$

$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{350} - \frac{1}{300} = 0.002857 - 0.003333 = -4.762 \times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}

## Advanced Kinetics: Rate-Determining Step and Mechanisms

### Rate-Determining Step

In a multi-step reaction, the slowest step determines the overall rate. The rate equation reflects
the molecularity of the rate-determining step.

**Example:** The reaction between propanone and iodine in acidic solution:

$$\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COCH}_3 + \mathrm{I}_2 \to \mathrm{CH}_2\mathrm{ICOCH}_3 + \mathrm{HI}$$

The observed rate equation is: Rate $= k[\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COCH}_3}][\mathrm{H}^+]$

Iodine does not appear in the rate equation, despite being a reactant. This means iodine
participates in a fast step after the rate-determining step.

**Proposed mechanism:**

Step 1 (slow, rate-determining): Protonation of propanone:

$$\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COCH}_3 + \mathrm{H}^+ \to \mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{C(OH}^+)\mathrm{CH}_3$$

Step 2 (fast): Enolisation:

$$\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{C(OH}^+)\mathrm{CH}_3 \to \mathrm{CH}_2=\mathrm{C(OH})\mathrm{CH}_3 + \mathrm{H}^+$$

Step 3 (fast): Reaction with iodine:

$$\mathrm{CH}_2=\mathrm{C(OH})\mathrm{CH}_3 + \mathrm{I}_2 \to \mathrm{CH}_2\mathrm{ICOCH}_3 + \mathrm{HI}$$

The rate equation (Rate $= k[\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COCH}_3}][\mathrm{H}^+]$) matches step 1,
confirming it is the rate-determining step.

### Steady-State Approximation (Brief Introduction)

For some mechanisms, the rate equation derived from the rate-determining step does not match the
experimental data because an intermediate accumulates. The steady-state approximation assumes that
the concentration of the intermediate remains constant (its rate of formation equals its rate of
consumption).

**Example:** The decomposition of $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5$:

$$2\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5 \to 4\mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{O}_2$$

Mechanism:

Step 1: $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5 \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{NO}_3$ (fast
equilibrium, $K_1$)

Step 2: $\mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{NO}_3 \to \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{NO}_2$ (slow)

Step 3: $\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{NO}_3 \to 2\mathrm{NO}_2$ (fast)

Applying the steady-state approximation to the intermediates $\mathrm{NO}_2$ and $\mathrm{NO}_3$
gives the rate equation:

$$\text{Rate} = k[\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5]$$

This is first-order with respect to $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_5$Consistent with experimental
observation.

### Catalysis in Detail

**Heterogeneous catalysis:** The catalyst provides a surface on which reactant molecules adsorb.
Adsorption weakens the bonds within the reactant molecules, lowering the activation energy.
Examples:

- Haber process: Iron catalyst for $\mathrm{N}_2 + 3\mathrm{H}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\mathrm{NH}_3$
- Contact process: $\mathrm{V}_2\mathrm{O}_5$ catalyst for
  $2\mathrm{SO}_2 + \mathrm{O}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\mathrm{SO}_3$

**Homogeneous catalysis:** The catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants. Example:

- Acid-catalysed esterification: $\mathrm{H}^+$ catalyses
  $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH} + \mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{CH}_2\mathrm{OH} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOCH}_2\mathrm{CH}_3 + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$

**Autocatalysis:** A product of the reaction acts as a catalyst for the reaction. Example:

- The reaction
  $\mathrm{MnO}_4^- + 5\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} + 8\mathrm{H}^+ \to \mathrm{Mn}^{2+} + 5\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + 4\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$
  is catalysed by $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ ions, which are produced in the reaction. The rate initially
  increases as more $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ accumulates, then decreases as reactants are consumed.

### Practical Techniques: Determining Rate Equations (AQA RP 8)

**Method 1: Initial rates method.**

1. Measure the initial rate at several different starting concentrations of one reactant (keeping
   others constant).
2. Plot initial rate vs concentration.
3. If the graph is linear, the reaction is first-order with respect to that reactant.
4. If the graph is a horizontal line, the reaction is zero-order.

**Method 2: Continuous monitoring.**

Monitor the concentration of a reactant or product over time. Common techniques:

- **Colorimetry:** Measure absorbance of a coloured species at regular intervals.
- **Gas collection:** Measure the volume of gas produced at regular intervals.
- **Titration:** Quench aliquots at regular intervals and titrate to determine concentration.
- **pH measurement:** Monitor pH for reactions involving $\mathrm{H}^+$ or $\mathrm{OH}^-$.

**Method 3: Half-life method.**

For a first-order reaction, the half-life is constant and independent of concentration. Plot
concentration vs time and measure the time for the concentration to halve at several points. If the
half-life is constant, the reaction is first-order.

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k} = \frac{0.693}{k}$$

### Arrhenius Applications: Catalyst Effect on Activation Energy

**Worked Example:** A reaction has $E_a = 75\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ without a catalyst and
$E_a = 50\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ with a catalyst. Calculate the ratio of rate constants at
$298\,\mathrm{K}$Assuming the pre-exponential factor $A$ is unchanged.

$$\frac{k_\text{cat}}{k_\text{uncat}} = \frac{Ae^{-E_{a,\text{cat}}/RT}}{Ae^{-E_{a,\text{uncat}}/RT}} = e^{(E_{a,\text{uncat}} - E_{a,\text{cat}})/RT}$$

$$= e^{(75000 - 50000)/(8.314 \times 298)} = e^{25000/2478} = e^{10.09} = 2.4 \times 10^4$$

The catalyst increases the rate by a factor of approximately 24,000 at $298\,\mathrm{K}$.

Explain the term activation energy. Describe how a catalyst increases the rate of a chemical
reaction.

**Mark Scheme:**

Activation energy is the minimum energy that colliding particles must have for a reaction to occur
(1 mark). It is the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state (1 mark).

A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (1 mark). More
particles have energy $\geq E_a$ (lower threshold), so a greater proportion of collisions are

For a first-order reaction, the concentration of reactant falls from $0.200\,\mathrm{mol\,dm^{-3}}$

(a) Calculate the rate constant. (2 marks)

$120k = 1.609 - 2.303 = -0.694$

## Summary

This topic covers the essential chemistry of chemical kinetics, including key reactions, underlying
theories, and practical applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- rate of reaction and collision theory
- the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
- effect of temperature and concentration
- catalysts and activation energy
- rate equations and orders of reaction

Mastery of these concepts requires both theoretical understanding and the ability to apply knowledge
to unfamiliar contexts, particularly in calculation and practical questions.

## Worked Examples

Worked examples demonstrating the application of key concepts are covered in the detailed sub-pages
linked above.
:::
## Common Mistakes

1. **Conflating order with stoichiometry.** The orders in the rate equation must be determined experimentally. They cannot be read from the balanced equation. A reaction with stoichiometry A + 2B → C may have rate = k[A]²[B] — the orders are independent of the coefficients.

2. **Incorrect units for k.** Always derive units from the rate equation. A rate constant with incorrect units in an answer will lose marks. Use dimensional analysis: Units of k = (mol dm⁻³)^(1-order) × s⁻¹.

3. **Assuming catalysts increase yield.** Catalysts increase rate, not yield. They lower the activation energy for both forward and reverse reactions equally, so the equilibrium position is unchanged. The catalyst helps reach equilibrium faster.

4. **Using the wrong half of an Arrhenius plot.** The x-axis must be 1/T (in K⁻¹), not T in °C. The gradient is −Eₐ/R, so Eₐ = −gradient × R. Students often forget the negative sign or use temperature in Celsius.

5. **Confusing initial rate with instantaneous rate.** The iodine clock and other clock reactions measure the initial rate (rate at t = 0). The thiosulphate amount must be small relative to the reactants for this approximation to hold.

## Intuition

Kinetics answers the question "how fast?" --- it is the study of reaction rates. Even if a reaction is thermodynamically favourable (it releases energy), it may still be painfully slow if molecules cannot get over the energy barrier. Think of it like pushing a boulder over a hill: it does not matter that the other side is downhill if you cannot get the boulder over the top. The activation energy is the height of that hill, and a catalyst is like building a tunnel through the hill --- it provides an alternative route with a lower barrier, so more molecules can make it across.

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution shows that at any given temperature, molecules have a range of energies. Only those with energy at or above the activation energy can react. Increasing temperature shifts the entire distribution, so a much larger fraction of molecules now have enough energy --- this is why even a small temperature increase can dramatically speed up a reaction. Concentration works differently: it does not change the energy distribution, but it packs more molecules into the same space, making collisions more frequent. The rate equation captures all of this mathematically, telling you exactly how sensitive the rate is to changes in concentration for each reactant.
