## 1. Linear Search

### Algorithm

**Problem:** Given an array $A[0..n-1]$ and a target value $x$Determine whether $x$ exists in $A$
And return its index (or $-1$ if not found).

```python
def linear_search(A, x):
    for i in range(len(A)):
        if A[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

### Correctness

**Theorem.** `linear_search(A, x)` returns the index of the first occurrence of $x$ in $A$Or $-1$ If
$x$ is not present.

**Proof.** The algorithm examines elements $A[0], A[1], \ldots$ in order. If $A[i] = x$It
Immediately returns $i$Which is the first occurrence since all earlier elements were checked and
Found not equal to $x$. If the loop completes without finding $x$Then $x \notin A$And $-1$ is
Returned. $\square$

### Complexity Analysis

**Theorem.** Linear search has worst-case time complexity $O(n)$ and best-case time complexity
$O(1)$.

**Proof of worst case.** In the worst case, $x$ is at index $n-1$ or absent. The algorithm performs
$n$ comparisons. Since each comparison takes $O(1)$ time, the total is $O(n)$. $\square$

**Proof of lower bound.** Linear search requires $\Omega(n)$ comparisons in the worst case.

**Proof.** Consider an adversary argument. An adversary can answer "not equal" to the first $n-1$
Comparisons. Only after checking all $n$ elements can the algorithm conclude that $x$ is absent. Any
Algorithm that does not check all $n$ positions can be fooled: the unchecked position could contain
$x$. Therefore, at least $n$ comparisons are necessary in the worst case. $\square$

| Case    | Comparisons | Time   |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Best    | 1           | $O(1)$ |
| Average | $n/2$       | $O(n)$ |
| Worst   | $n$         | $O(n)$ |

## 2. Binary Search

### Algorithm

**Problem:** Given a **sorted** array $A[0..n-1]$ and a target value $x$Find the index of $x$ (or
Determine that $x$ is not present).

```python
def binary_search(A, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(A) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if A[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif A[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

### Correctness Proof

**Theorem.** `binary_search(A, x)` returns the index of $x$ in the sorted array $A$Or $-1$ if $x$ Is
not present.

**Proof.** We prove by invariant.

**Invariant:** At the start of each loop iteration, if $x$ exists in $A$Then
$x \in A[\mathrm{low}..\mathrm{high}]$.

**Base case.** Initially, `low = 0` and `high = n-1`So
$A[\mathrm{low}..\mathrm{high}] = A[0..n-1] = A$. If $x \in A$The invariant holds.

**Maintenance.** Three cases:

1. $A[\mathrm{mid}] = x$: Return mid. Correct. ✓
2. $A[\mathrm{mid}] \lt x$: Since $A$ is sorted, $A[0..\mathrm{mid}] \leq A[\mathrm{mid}] \lt x$So
   $x \notin A[0..\mathrm{mid}]$. Setting `low = mid + 1` restricts the search to
   $A[\mathrm{mid}+1..\mathrm{high}]$. If $x$ was in the old range, it is in the new range.
3. $A[\mathrm{mid}] \gt x$: Since $A$ is sorted, $A[\mathrm{mid}..n-1] \geq A[\mathrm{mid}] \gt x$So
   $x \notin A[\mathrm{mid}..n-1]$. Setting `high = mid - 1` restricts the search to
   $A[\mathrm{low}..\mathrm{mid}-1]$. If $x$ was in the old range, it is in the new range.

**Termination.** The loop terminates when `low > high`Meaning $A[\mathrm{low}..\mathrm{high}]$ is
Empty. By the invariant, $x \notin A$. Return $-1$. ✓

$\square$

### Complexity Analysis

**Theorem.** Binary search performs $O(\log n)$ comparisons.

**Proof.** At each iteration, the search range is halved. Starting with a range of size $n$After $k$
iterations the range size is at most $\lceil n/2^k \rceil$. The algorithm terminates when the Range
is empty, which happens when $n/2^k \lt 1$I.e., $k \gt \log_2 n$. Therefore, the maximum Number of
iterations is $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1 = O(\log n)$. $\square$

**Formal derivation.** Let $T(n)$ be the number of comparisons for an array of size $n$.

$$T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1), \quad T(1) = O(1)$$

By the Master Theorem (case 2): $T(n) = O(\log n)$.

**Theorem (Binary search lower bound).** Any comparison-based search algorithm on a sorted array
Requires $\Omega(\log n)$ comparisons in the worst case.

**Proof.** A decision tree for searching a sorted array of $n$ elements has at least $n + 1$ leaves
($n$ possible positions for $x$Plus "not found"). A binary tree of height $h$ has at most
$2^{h+1} - 1$ leaves, so:

$$n + 1 \leq 2^{h+1} - 1 \implies h \geq \lceil \log_2(n + 2) \rceil - 1 = \Omega(\log n)$$

$\square$

## Problem Set

**Problem 1.** Trace linear search for the value 8 in the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`. How many
Comparisons are made?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The value 8 is not in the array. All 8 elements are checked:

| Step | Index | A[index] | Comparison | Count |
| ---- | ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1    | 0     | 3        | 3 ≠ 8      | 1     |
| 2    | 1     | 1        | 1 ≠ 8      | 2     |
| 3    | 2     | 4        | 4 ≠ 8      | 3     |
| 4    | 3     | 1        | 1 ≠ 8      | 4     |
| 5    | 4     | 5        | 5 ≠ 8      | 5     |
| 6    | 5     | 9        | 9 ≠ 8      | 6     |
| 7    | 6     | 2        | 2 ≠ 8      | 7     |
| 8    | 7     | 6        | 6 ≠ 8      | 8     |

Total comparisons: 8. Return -1.

**Problem 2.** Trace binary search for the value 25 in the sorted array
`[2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]`. Show all iterations.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

| Iteration | low | high | mid | A[mid] | Action            |
| --------- | --- | ---- | --- | ------ | ----------------- |
| 1         | 0   | 9    | 4   | 16     | 16 < 25, low = 5  |
| 2         | 5   | 9    | 7   | 56     | 56 > 25, high = 6 |
| 3         | 5   | 6    | 5   | 23     | 23 < 25, low = 6  |
| 4         | 6   | 6    | 6   | 38     | 38 > 25, high = 5 |
| 5         | 6   | 5    | —   | —      | low > high → -1   |

4 comparisons. Result: -1.

</details>

**Problem 3.** An array of 1024 elements is searched using binary search. What is the maximum number
Of comparisons required?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

$\lfloor \log_2 1024 \rfloor + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11$ comparisons.

More precisely, binary search on $n = 1024$ elements requires at most
$\lceil \log_2(1024 + 1) \rceil = \lceil 10.001 \rceil = 11$ comparisons.

</details>

**Problem 4.** Prove that binary search cannot be directly applied to a singly linked list, and
Explain what alternative approach could achieve $O(\log n)$ search on a linked list.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Binary search requires $O(1)$ access to the middle element (A[mid]). In a singly linked list,
Accessing the $k$-th element requires traversing $k$ nodes from the head, which is $O(k)$. Finding
The middle of a list of $n$ elements takes $O(n/2) = O(n)$ time, eliminating the benefit of halving.

Alternative: **Jump list / Skip list** — a data structure with multiple levels of linked lists that
Allows $O(\log n)$ search by "skipping" ahead at higher levels, analogous to binary search.

</details>

**Problem 5.** Explain why the worst case for linear search is $\Omega(n)$ using an adversary
Argument.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

An adversary constructs the worst case dynamically. The adversary maintains that the target $x$ is
Not at any position already examined by the algorithm. After $n - 1$ comparisons, all positions
Except one have been checked. The adversary places $x$ at the remaining unchecked position (or
Declares it absent). Therefore, any correct algorithm must check all $n$ positions in the worst
Case, requiring $\Omega(n)$ comparisons. $\square$

</details>

**Problem 6.** Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a value in a sorted array
Using binary search. Your function should run in $O(\log n)$ time.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Find the leftmost and rightmost occurrence using binary search, then compute the difference.

```python
def count_occurrences(A, x):
    left = binary_search_insert_position(A, x)
    right = binary_search_insert_position(A, x + 1) - 1
    if left <= right and left < len(A) and A[left] == x:
        return right - left + 1
    return 0
```

Two binary searches: $O(\log n) + O(\log n) = O(\log n)$.

</details>

**Problem 7.** Given an array that is sorted but rotated (e.g., `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`), write a
Modified binary search that runs in $O(\log n)$ time.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```python
def search_rotated(A, x):
    low, high = 0, len(A) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if A[mid] == x:
            return mid
        if A[low] <= A[mid]:
            if A[low] <= x < A[mid]:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        else:
            if A[mid] < x <= A[high]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

The key insight: one half of the array (left or right of mid) is always sorted. Determine which half
Is sorted and whether the target lies within it.

</details>

**Problem 8.** A binary search implementation has the following bug: `mid = (low + high) / 2` (using
Floating-point division instead of integer division). What goes wrong?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

In Python, `/` produces a float, and using a float as an array index raises a `TypeError`. In
Languages like C/Java, `int mid = (low + high) / 2` truncates toward zero, which works correctly for
Positive values but is technically implementation-dependent.

The more serious bug is **integer overflow**: if `low + high > INT_MAX`The sum overflows. The
Correct form is `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`Which cannot overflow since `high - low` is always
Non-negative and less than `INT_MAX`.

## Problems

**Problem 1.** Trace linear search for the value 14 in the array `[7, 3, 14, 2, 9, 6, 1, 8]`. How
Many comparisons are made until the item is found?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Step through each element from index 0, comparing each with the target 14. Count each comparison
Until a match is found.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

| Step | Index | A[index] | Comparison | Count |
| ---- | ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1    | 0     | 7        | 7 ≠ 14     | 1     |

| 3    | 2     | 14       | 14 = 14 ✓  | 3     |

3 comparisons are made. The value 14 is found at index 2. The algorithm returns 2.

**Problem 2.** Trace linear search for the value 5 in the array
`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]`. How many comparisons are made?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

The value 5 is not in the array, so the algorithm must check every single element before returning
-1.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

| Step | Index | A[index] | Comparison | Count |
| ---- | ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1    | 0     | 10       | 10 ≠ 5     | 1     |

| 6    | 5     | 60       | 60 ≠ 5     | 6     |
| 7    | 6     | 70       | 70 ≠ 5     | 7     |
| 8    | 7     | 80       | 80 ≠ 5     | 8     |
| 9    | 8     | 90       | 90 ≠ 5     | 9     |

9 comparisons are made. The value 5 is not found, so the algorithm returns -1. This is the worst
Case for an array of 9 elements — every element must be checked.

<summary>Hint</summary>

Start with low = 0, high = 9. Calculate mid = (0 + 9) // 2 = 4. Compare A[4] with 42 and adjust the
Range accordingly.

</details>

| 2         | 5   | 9    | 7   | 58     | 58 > 42, high = 6 |
| 3         | 5   | 6    | 5   | 42     | Found! Return 5   |

3 comparisons are made. The value 42 is found at index 5.

</details>

**Problem 4.** Trace binary search for the value 15 in the sorted array
`[2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30]`. Show all iterations.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

The value 15 lies between 14 (index 3) and 18 (index 4). The algorithm will narrow down to this gap
And then terminate with low > high.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

| Iteration | low | high | mid | A[mid] | Action             |
| --------- | --- | ---- | --- | ------ | ------------------ |
| 1         | 0   | 7    | 3   | 14     | 14 < 15, low = 4   |

| 4         | 4   | 3    | —   | —      | low > high, return |

4 comparisons are made. The value 15 is not in the array, so the algorithm returns -1.

**Problem 5.** An unsorted array of 10,000 elements must be searched repeatedly. Compare the total
Cost of using linear search directly for 1,000 queries versus sorting the array once then using
Binary search for 1,000 queries.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Calculate the cost of each approach: (a) 1,000 linear searches, and (b) one sort plus 1,000 binary
Searches. Use O(n log n) for sorting and O(log n) for each binary search.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Linear search approach:** 1,000 × O(10,000) = O(10,000,000) total comparisons.

**Sort + binary search approach:**

- One-time sort: O(10,000 log₂ 10,000) ≈ O(10,000 × 13.3) ≈ O(133,000) comparisons
- 1,000 binary searches: 1,000 × O(log₂ 10,000) ≈ 1,000 × 14 = O(14,000) comparisons
- Total: O(133,000) + O(14,000) = O(147,000) comparisons

Sort + binary search is approximately **68 times more efficient** in total. The one-time cost of
Sorting is quickly amortised over multiple queries. The more queries needed, the greater the
Advantage of sorting first.

**Problem 6.** A database contains 500,000 records sorted by a unique key field. Explain which
Search algorithm is more efficient and calculate the maximum number of comparisons for each
Algorithm.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Since the data is already sorted, binary search can be applied directly. Calculate ⌊log₂(n)⌋ + 1 for
The binary search worst case.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Linear search:** Worst case = 500,000 comparisons. Time complexity: $O(n)$.

**Binary search:** Worst case =
$\lfloor \log_2(500\,000) \rfloor + 1 = \lfloor 18.93 \rfloor + 1 = 19$ comparisons. Time
Complexity: $O(\log n)$.

Binary search is dramatically more efficient — at most 19 comparisons versus 500,000 for linear
Search, an improvement factor of approximately 26,000×. Since the data is already sorted, there is
No additional preprocessing cost.

**Problem 7.** Calculate the maximum number of comparisons required for binary search on arrays of
Sizes 15, 100, 500, and 1,000,000. Show your working using the formula

<summary>Answer</summary>

Using $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1$:

| $n$       | $\log_2 n$ | $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ | Max comparisons |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| 15        | 3.91       | 3                          | 3 + 1 = **4**   |
| 100       | 6.64       | 6                          | 6 + 1 = **7**   |
| 500       | 8.97       | 8                          | 8 + 1 = **9**   |
| 1,000,000 | 19.93      | 19                         | 19 + 1 = **20** |

This demonstrates the power of logarithmic growth: searching through a million elements requires
Only 20 comparisons maximum.

**Problem 8.** Write pseudocode for (a) a linear search that returns the index of the first
Occurrence of a target value in an array, and (b) a binary search on a sorted array that returns the
Index of the target or -1 if not found.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Linear search uses a simple FOR loop checking each element. Binary search uses a WHILE loop with low
And high pointers, calculating mid each iteration.

<summary>Answer</summary>

**(a) Linear search:**

```
FUNCTION LinearSearch(A, x)
    FOR i ← 0 TO LEN(A) - 1
        IF A[i] = x THEN
            RETURN i
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    RETURN -1
ENDFUNCTION
```

**(b) Binary search:**

```
FUNCTION BinarySearch(A, x)
    low ← 0
    high ← LEN(A) - 1
    WHILE low ≤ high
        mid ← (low + high) DIV 2
        IF A[mid] = x THEN
            RETURN mid
        ELSE IF A[mid] < x THEN
            low ← mid + 1
        ELSE
            high ← mid - 1
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
    RETURN -1
ENDFUNCTION
```

Note: In the binary search, `DIV 2` performs integer division (floor division), which is equivalent
To `//` in Python.

**Problem 9.** Trace binary search for the value 17 in the sorted array
`[4, 8, 12, 15, 17, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40]`. Show low, high, mid, and the comparison at each step.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

The array has 11 elements (indices 0–10). Start with low = 0, high = 10. The first mid will be
(0 + 10) // 2 = 5.

| Iteration | low | high | mid | A[mid] | Comparison | Action          |
| --------- | --- | ---- | --- | ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| 1         | 0   | 10   | 5   | 20     | 20 > 17    | high = 4        |
| 2         | 0   | 4    | 2   | 12     | 12 < 17    | low = 3         |
| 3         | 3   | 4    | 3   | 15     | 15 < 17    | low = 4         |
| 4         | 4   | 4    | 4   | 17     | 17 = 17 ✓  | Found! Return 4 |

4 comparisons are made. The value 17 is found at index 4.

**Problem 10.** (Exam-style) A school library system stores 20,000 book records. The librarian needs
To: (a) search for a book by its ISBN (the catalogue is sorted by ISBN), (b) check whether a
Specific book ID exists in an unsorted list of 50 recently returned books, (c) find the price of a
Book given its ISBN in a sorted price catalogue. For each scenario, justify which search algorithm
Is most appropriate, stating your assumptions about the data structure and ordering.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Consider three factors for each scenario: (1) Is the data sorted? (2) How large is the dataset? (3)
How many searches will be performed? The cost of sorting must be weighed against the benefit of
Binary search.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**(a) Binary search.** The ISBN catalogue is sorted and stored in an array with random access.
Binary search requires at most $\lfloor \log_2(20\,000) \rfloor + 1 = 15$ comparisons, compared to
20,000 for linear search. This is efficient and appropriate since no preprocessing is needed.

**(b) Linear search.** The list of 50 recently returned books is unsorted and small. Linear search
Takes at most 50 comparisons — negligible cost. Sorting first would cost $O(50 \log 50) \approx 282$
Operations, which exceeds the 50 comparisons needed for a single search. For a single check, linear
Search is optimal. If many repeated searches were needed, sorting first and using binary search (7
Comparisons max) would become worthwhile after approximately 6 searches ($282 / 50 \approx 5.6$).

**(c) Binary search.** The price catalogue is sorted by ISBN with random access. Binary search finds
The ISBN in $O(\log 20\,000) \approx 15$ comparisons, then retrieves the price at that index in
$O(1)$. Linear search would require $O(20\,000)$ comparisons — unnecessary when the data is already
Sorted.

**Summary:**

| Scenario              | Data size | Sorted? | Best algorithm | Max comparisons |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| (a) ISBN lookup       | 20,000    | Yes     | Binary search  | 15              |
| (b) Recently returned | 50        | No      | Linear search  | 50              |
| (c) Price lookup      | 20,000    | Yes     | Binary search  | 15              |

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that binary search requires a sorted array. Applying it to unsorted data gives
   incorrect results.

2. Confusing the number of comparisons with the number of elements examined in binary search.

3. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).

4. Forgetting that $O(n \log n)$ average-case for quicksort becomes $O(n^2)$ worst-case on already
   sorted input.

5. Misunderstanding the difference between a stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO) in data structure
   applications.

6. Confusing an algorithm with a program. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, not its
   implementation in code.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using binary search on an unsorted array.** Binary search requires the array to be sorted. Applying it to unsorted data gives incorrect results because the comparison logic (discarding half the array) relies on the sorted order.

2. **Confusing the mid calculation and causing integer overflow.** Computing `mid = (low + high) // 2` can overflow in languages with fixed-width integers when `low + high > INT_MAX`. The safe alternative is `mid = low + (high - low) // 2`.

3. **Forgetting that binary search on a linked list is not O(log n).** Binary search requires O(1) random access to the middle element. Linked lists require O(n) traversal to reach the middle, making binary search O(n) — no better than linear search.

4. **Not understanding why the worst case for linear search is Ω(n).** An adversary can place the target at the last position checked or declare it absent. Any algorithm that doesn't check all n positions can be fooled. This is a lower bound, not just an observation.

5. **Miscounting comparisons in binary search traces.** Each iteration of binary search involves exactly one comparison (A[mid] vs target). Students sometimes count multiple comparisons per iteration or forget that the loop termination condition itself is a comparison.

## Intuition

Searching is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science, and the two classic approaches — linear and binary search — illustrate a core trade-off: simplicity versus speed. Linear search is the obvious strategy: start at the beginning and check every item until you find what you are looking for. It works on any collection, sorted or not, but it is slow for large datasets because you might have to look at every single element. Binary search, by contrast, exploits order. By repeatedly halving the search space, it narrows down the target in logarithmic time — for a million items, it needs at most 20 comparisons instead of a million.

The key insight behind binary search is the power of eliminating half the possibilities at each step. Imagine looking up a word in a dictionary: you open it roughly in the middle, see whether your word comes before or after, and immediately discard half the pages. You repeat this until you find the word. This "divide and conquer" principle appears throughout computer science, from sorting algorithms to tree traversals. The catch is that binary search only works on sorted data, so if your data is not already ordered, you must pay the cost of sorting first — a decision that depends on how many searches you plan to perform.

In practice, the choice between algorithms depends on context. For small datasets, the overhead of binary search's index management may not be worth it — linear search is simpler and fast enough. For large, frequently searched datasets, binary search (or its variants like interpolation search) is dramatically faster. Real-world systems often use hash tables for O(1) average-case lookups when exact matching is needed, or balanced binary search trees when both searching and ordered traversal are required. Understanding these trade-offs — data size, whether data is sorted, the cost of preprocessing, and the pattern of access — is what lets you choose the right tool for the job.
