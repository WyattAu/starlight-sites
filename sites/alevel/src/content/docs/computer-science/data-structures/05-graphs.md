## 1. Graph Fundamentals

### Definition

A **graph** $G = (V, E)$ consists of a set of **vertices** (nodes) $V$ and a set of **edges**
$E \subseteq V \times V$.

- **Undirected graph:** Edges have no direction; $(u, v) = (v, u)$
- **Directed graph (digraph):** Edges are ordered pairs; $(u, v) \neq (v, u)$
- **Weighted graph:** Each edge has an associated weight $w: E \to \mathbb{R}$

### Terminology

| Term       | Definition                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adjacent   | Two vertices connected by an edge                            |
| Degree     | Number of edges incident to a vertex (undirected)            |
| In-degree  | Number of incoming edges (directed)                          |
| Out-degree | Number of outgoing edges (directed)                          |
| Path       | Sequence of vertices where consecutive vertices are adjacent |
| Cycle      | Path that starts and ends at the same vertex                 |
| Connected  | There is a path between every pair of vertices               |
| DAG        | Directed Acyclic Graph — a directed graph with no cycles     |

**Theorem (Handshaking Lemma).** The sum of all vertex degrees equals $2|E|$.

**Proof.** Each edge contributes 1 to the degree of each of its two endpoints. Summing degrees
Counts each edge exactly twice. $\square$

## 2. Graph Representations

### Adjacency Matrix

An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i][j] = 1$ if edge $(i, j)$ exists (0 otherwise). For weighted
Graphs, $A[i][j] = w(i,j)$.

| Property          | Value    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Space             | $O(n^2)$ |
| Add edge          | $O(1)$   |
| Remove edge       | $O(1)$   |
| Check adjacency   | $O(1)$   |
| List neighbours   | $O(n)$   |
| Iterate all edges | $O(n^2)$ |

**Best for:** Dense graphs ($|E| \approx n^2$).

### Adjacency List

An array of $n$ lists, where `adj[i]` contains all vertices adjacent to vertex $i$.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, n, directed=False):
        self.n = n
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        self.directed = directed

    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        self.adj[u].append((v, weight))
        if not self.directed:
            self.adj[v].append((u, weight))
```

| Property          | Value                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Space             | $O(n + \lvert E \rvert)$ |
| Add edge          | $O(1)$                   |
| Remove edge       | $O(\mathrm{degree})$     |
| Check adjacency   | $O(\mathrm{degree})$     |
| List neighbours   | $O(\mathrm{degree})$     |
| Iterate all edges | $O(n + \lvert E \rvert)$ |

**Best for:** Sparse graphs ($|E| \ll n^2$).

### Comparison

| Property      | Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List    |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Space         | $O(V^2)$         | $O(V + E)$        |
| Edge lookup   | $O(1)$           | $O(\mathrm{deg})$ |
| Add edge      | $O(1)$           | $O(1)$            |
| Sparse graphs | Wasteful         | Efficient         |
| Dense graphs  | Efficient        | Slightly slower   |

## 3. Graph Traversals

### 3.1 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS explores vertices level by level, using a queue.

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = [False] * graph.n
    distance = [-1] * graph.n
    queue = deque([start])
    visited[start] = True
    distance[start] = 0

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        for v, w in graph.adj[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                visited[v] = True
                distance[v] = distance[u] + 1
                queue.append(v)

    return distance
```

**Theorem (BFS finds shortest paths).** In an unweighted graph, BFS from source $s$ computes the
Shortest-path distance $d(s, v)$ for every vertex $v$.

**Proof.** We prove by induction on the distance $d$ that all vertices at distance $d$ from $s$ are
Discovered (enqueued) at distance $d$And no vertex is discovered at a distance greater than its True
shortest distance.

_Base case ($d = 0$)._ $s$ is at distance 0 and is discovered at distance 0.

_Inductive step._ Assume all vertices at distance $d$ are discovered at distance $d$. When a vertex
$u$ at distance $d$ is dequeued, all unvisited neighbours $v$ are at distance at most $d + 1$ (by
Edge relaxation). If $v$ were at distance $\lt d + 1$It would have been discovered earlier (by The
inductive hypothesis or a previous BFS level). So $v$ is at distance exactly $d + 1$ and is
Discovered at that distance. No vertex can be discovered at distance $\gt d + 1$ through $u$ Since
each edge adds exactly 1 to the path length. $\square$

**Complexity:** $O(V + E)$ — each vertex is visited once, each edge is examined at most twice (once
From each endpoint in undirected graphs).

### 3.2 Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, using a stack (or recursion).

```python
def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = [False] * graph.n

    def dfs_visit(u):
        visited[u] = True
        for v, w in graph.adj[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                dfs_visit(v)

    dfs_visit(start)
```

**Complexity:** $O(V + E)$ — same analysis as BFS.

### BFS vs DFS

| Property       | BFS                        | DFS                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data structure | Queue                      | Stack (recursion)                                       |
| Exploration    | Level by level             | Branch by branch                                        |
| Shortest path  | Yes (unweighted)           | No                                                      |
| Memory         | $O(V)$ (queue)             | $O(V)$ (recursion stack)                                |
| Use cases      | Shortest path, level order | Cycle detection, topological sort, connected components |

## 4. Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Problem

Find the shortest path from a source vertex $s$ to all other vertices in a **weighted graph with
Non-negative weights**.

### Algorithm

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, source):
    dist = [float('inf')] * graph.n
    dist[source] = 0
    pq = [(0, source)]
    visited = [False] * graph.n

    while pq:
        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if visited[u]:
            continue
        visited[u] = True
        for v, w in graph.adj[u]:
            if not visited[v] and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))

    return dist
```

### Correctness Proof

**Theorem.** Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest-path distance from $s$ to every vertex $v$
In a graph with non-negative edge weights.

**Proof.** We prove by induction that when a vertex $u$ is extracted from the priority queue (marked
Visited), $\mathrm{dist}[u]$ equals the true shortest distance $d(s, u)$.

Let $S$ be the set of visited vertices. We maintain the **invariant**: for every $u \in S$
$\mathrm{dist}[u] = d(s, u)$.

_Base case._ $s$ is extracted first with $\mathrm{dist}[s] = 0 = d(s, s)$. ✓

_Inductive step._ Let $u$ be the next vertex extracted. Assume for contradiction that
$\mathrm{dist}[u] \gt d(s, u)$. Then there exists a shortest path $P$ from $s$ to $u$. Let $x$ be
The first vertex on $P$ not in $S$And let $y$ be the predecessor of $x$ on $P$ ($y \in S$). Then:

$$\mathrm{dist}[x] \leq \mathrm{dist}[y] + w(y, x) = d(s, y) + w(y, x) = d(s, x) \leq d(s, u) < \mathrm{dist}[u]$$

Since $\mathrm{dist}[x] \lt \mathrm{dist}[u]$, $x$ would have been extracted from the priority Queue
before $u$ — contradiction. Therefore $\mathrm{dist}[u] = d(s, u)$. $\square$

**Complexity:** With a binary heap: $O((V + E) \log V)$. Each vertex is extracted once ($O(\log V)$
Each), and each edge causes at most one decrease-key ($O(\log V)$ each).

> **Caution:** Warning Bellman-Ford algorithm instead for graphs that may contain negative weights.

## 5. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

### Definition

A **spanning tree** of a connected graph $G$ is a subgraph that is a tree and includes all vertices.
A **minimum spanning tree** is the spanning tree with the minimum total edge weight.

### Cut Property

**Lemma (Cut Property).** For any cut of the graph, the minimum-weight edge crossing the cut belongs
To **some** MST.

**Proof.** Let $e$ be the minimum-weight edge crossing cut $(S, V \setminus S)$. Suppose $e$ is not
In MST $T$. Adding $e$ to $T$ creates a cycle. This cycle must cross the cut at least twice (once
Via $e$), so there exists another edge $e'$ in the cycle crossing the cut. Since $e$ is the
Minimum-weight crossing edge, $w(e) \leq w(e')$. Replacing $e'$ with $e$ in $T$ yields a spanning
Tree with weight $\leq w(T)$. Since $T$ is minimum, $w(e) = w(e')$And the new tree is also an MST
Containing $e$. $\square$

### Kruskal's Algorithm

```python
def kruskal(graph):
    edges = []
    for u in range(graph.n):
        for v, w in graph.adj[u]:
            if u < v:
                edges.append((w, u, v))
    edges.sort()

    parent = list(range(graph.n))
    rank = [0] * graph.n

    def find(x):
        while parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = parent[parent[x]]
            x = parent[x]
        return x

    def union(x, y):
        rx, ry = find(x), find(y)
        if rx == ry:
            return False
        if rank[rx] < rank[ry]:
            rx, ry = ry, rx
        parent[ry] = rx
        if rank[rx] == rank[ry]:
            rank[rx] += 1
        return True

    mst = []
    for w, u, v in edges:
        if union(u, v):
            mst.append((u, v, w))
            if len(mst) == graph.n - 1:
                break

    return mst
```

**Correctness.** Kruskal's algorithm is correct by the cut property. When an edge $e$ is added, the
Vertices it connects are in different components — this defines a cut where $e$ is the minimum
Crossing edge (since edges are processed in sorted order). By the cut property, $e$ belongs to some
MST.

**Complexity:** Sorting: $O(E \log E)$. Union-Find operations: $O(E \cdot \alpha(V))$Where $\alpha$
is the inverse Ackermann function (effectively $O(1)$). Total: $O(E \log E) = O(E \log V)$.

### Prim's Algorithm

```python
def prim(graph, start):
    dist = [float('inf')] * graph.n
    in_mst = [False] * graph.n
    dist[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    mst_weight = 0

    while pq:
        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if in_mst[u]:
            continue
        in_mst[u] = True
        mst_weight += d
        for v, w in graph.adj[u]:
            if not in_mst[v] and w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = w
                heapq.heappush(pq, (w, v))

    return mst_weight
```

**Correctness.** Prim's is correct by the cut property. At each step, the cut separates MST vertices
From non-MST vertices, and the algorithm selects the minimum-weight crossing edge.

**Complexity:** $O((V + E) \log V)$ with a binary heap.

<hr />

## 6. Topological Sort

A **topological ordering** of a DAG is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed
Edge $(u, v)$, $u$ comes before $v$.

**Algorithm:** DFS-based. When a vertex finishes, prepend it to the result.

```python
def topological_sort(graph):
    visited = [False] * graph.n
    result = []

    def visit(u):
        visited[u] = True
        for v, _ in graph.adj[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                visit(v)
        result.append(u)

    for u in range(graph.n):
        if not visited[u]:
            visit(u)

    return result[::-1]
```

**Complexity:** $O(V + E)$.

<hr />

</details>

**Problem 5.** Prove that BFS uses $O(V)$ space in the worst case.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

In the worst case, all vertices at the same distance from the source are in the queue
Simultaneously. In a graph where the source is connected to all other vertices, at distance 1 there
Are $V - 1$ vertices in the queue. In a star graph, the maximum queue size is $V - 1$. In a complete
Graph, BFS visits one level at a time, and the maximum queue size is bounded by the number of
Vertices at the maximum depth, which is at most $V - 1$. Hence the space is $O(V)$. $\square$

</details>

**Problem 6.** Given a DAG, explain why topological sort is possible but BFS-based shortest path
(for unweighted graphs) might not produce correct results if cycles exist.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Topological sort is only defined for DAGs (graphs without directed cycles). If a directed cycle
Exists, there is no valid topological ordering because for any edge $(u, v)$ in the cycle, $u$ must
Come before $v$And following the cycle leads to a contradiction.

For shortest paths: in an unweighted graph with cycles, BFS still works correctly because BFS visits
Each vertex at most once (it marks vertices as visited). The shortest path distance is still
Well-defined even with cycles, since a cycle would only increase the path length. However, for
**weighted** graphs with negative cycles, shortest paths are undefined (you can keep going around
The cycle to decrease the distance).

</details>

**Problem 7.** A graph has 6 vertices and 9 edges. What is the sum of all vertex degrees? Is this
Graph necessarily connected?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

By the Handshaking Lemma: sum of degrees = $2|E| = 2 \times 9 = 18$.

The graph is not necessarily connected. For example, it could consist of a $K_4$ (complete graph on
4 vertices, 6 edges) plus a path of 3 vertices (2 edges) plus an isolated vertex, totalling
$6 + 2 = 8$ edges — but we need 9 edges. A valid disconnected example: $K_4$ (6 edges) + a triangle
(3 edges) = 9 edges, 7 vertices... That's too many. Actually, 6 vertices: $K_4$ (6 edges, 4
Vertices) + an edge between the remaining 2 vertices (1 edge) + 2 more edges within the remaining 2
Vertices is impossible. Let me reconsider: 6 vertices, 9 edges. Minimum edges for connected = 5
(tree). 9 > 5, so it **could** be connected but isn't **necessarily** connected. Example: a $K_4$ on
Vertices 1-4 (6 edges) and a $K_3$ on vertices 4-6... No, they share vertex 4, making it connected.
Two separate components: component 1 has 4 vertices with 6 edges ($K_4$), component 2 has 2 vertices
With 1 edge, but that's only 7 edges. To get 9: $K_4$ (6 edges, 4 vertices) + $K_3$ minus 1 edge = 2
Edges, 3 vertices. But that requires 7 vertices. With 6 vertices: 5 in one component, 1 isolated.
$K_5$ has 10 edges, too many. So with 6 vertices and 9 edges, the graph **must** be connected
(minimum edges to disconnect would leave one isolated vertex, requiring $\leq \binom{5}{2} = 10$
Edges among the other 5, but 9 < 10, so it's possible: 9 edges among 5 vertices and 1 isolated).
Yes, it's possible to be disconnected: 5 vertices with 9 edges + 1 isolated vertex. 9 edges among 5
Vertices means the graph on those 5 vertices has 9 edges, which is possible ($K_5$ has 10). So the
Answer is: no, not necessarily connected.

</details>

**Problem 8.** Explain why Dijkstra's algorithm fails with negative edge weights. Give a
Counterexample.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Dijkstra's algorithm relies on the **greedy choice property**: once a vertex $u$ is extracted from
The priority queue, $\mathrm{dist}[u]$ is assumed to be final. This is valid only when all edge
Weights are non-negative, because any alternative path to $u$ must pass through an unvisited vertex
Whose distance is at least $\mathrm{dist}[u]$.

With negative edges, a shorter path to an already-visited vertex may be discovered later through a
Not-yet-visited vertex, invalidating the greedy choice.

**Counterexample (CLRS, Exercise 24.3-5).** Consider vertices $S, A, B, C$ with edges:

$$S \xrightarrow{1} A \xrightarrow{2} B \xrightarrow{1} C, \quad S \xrightarrow{4} C \xrightarrow{-3} B$$

**Dijkstra execution:**

| Step | Extract | dist[S] | dist[A]  | dist[B]  | dist[C]  |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0    | —       | 0       | $\infty$ | $\infty$ | $\infty$ |
| 1    | S (0)   | 0       | 1        | $\infty$ | 4        |
| 2    | A (1)   | 0       | 1        | 3        | 4        |
| 3    | B (3)   | 0       | 1        | **3**    | 4        |
| 4    | C (4)   | 0       | 1        | 3        | **4**    |

Dijkstra outputs $\mathrm{dist}[B] = 3$. But the true shortest path is
$S \to C \to B = 4 + (-3) = 1$. The algorithm fails because when $C$ is extracted at distance 4, it
Finds a shorter path to $B$ ($4 - 3 = 1$), but $B$ has already been extracted and marked as visited.

**Recovery:** Use the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which correctly handles negative edge weights by
Relaxing all edges $|V| - 1$ times. Bellman-Ford also detects negative-weight cycles.

**Problem 9.** Perform a topological sort on the following DAG: edges A→B, A→C, B→D, C→D, D→E.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Using DFS-based topological sort:

DFS from A: visit A → visit B → visit D → visit E → E finished, D finished, B finished → visit C → C
Finished, A finished.

Finish order (reverse): A, C, B, D, E → reversed: E, D, B, C, A... Wait.

DFS finishes: E, D, B, C, A. Reverse: A, C, B, D, E.

Check: A before B ✓, A before C ✓, B before D ✓, C before D ✓, D before E ✓.

Valid topological order: A, B, C, D, E (or A, C, B, D, E).

**Problem 10.** Compare Kruskal's and Prim's MST algorithms in terms of time complexity for dense
And sparse graphs.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

| Graph type              | Kruskal         | Prim (binary heap) |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Sparse ($E \approx V$)  | $O(V \log V)$   | $O(V \log V)$      |
| Dense ($E \approx V^2$) | $O(V^2 \log V)$ | $O(V^2 \log V)$    |

Kruskal: $O(E \log E) = O(E \log V)$. Prim (binary heap): $O((V+E) \log V)$.

For dense graphs: Prim with an adjacency matrix (no heap) runs in $O(V^2)$Which is better than
Kruskal's $O(V^2 \log V)$.

**Problem 11.** Prove that a tree with $n$ vertices has exactly $n - 1$ edges using induction.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Proof by induction on $n$.**

Base case: $n = 1$. A single vertex has 0 edges. $0 = 1 - 1$. ✓

Inductive step: Assume all trees with $k$ vertices have $k - 1$ edges. Consider a tree $T$ with
$k + 1$ vertices. Since $T$ has at least 2 vertices (for $k \geq 1$), it has at least one leaf $v$
(a tree with $\geq 2$ vertices always has a leaf — otherwise every vertex has degree $\geq 1$And
With no cycles, we'd need $\geq n$ edges, contradicting $|E| = n - 1$). Remove leaf $v$ and its
Single incident edge. The resulting graph $T'$ is still a tree (removing a leaf cannot create a
Cycle, and $T'$ is still connected since $v$ was only connected to one vertex). $T'$ has $k$
Vertices, so by the inductive hypothesis, $T'$ has $k - 1$ edges. Adding back $v$ and its edge gives
$(k - 1) + 1 = k$ edges. ✓ $\square$

**Problem 12.** Given a graph represented as an adjacency list, write a function to detect whether
It contains a cycle using DFS.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```python
def has_cycle(graph):
    visited = [False] * graph.n
    rec_stack = [False] * graph.n

    def dfs(u):
        visited[u] = True
        rec_stack[u] = True
        for v, _ in graph.adj[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                if dfs(v):
                    return True
            elif rec_stack[v]:
                return True
        rec_stack[u] = False
        return False

    for u in range(graph.n):
        if not visited[u]:
            if dfs(u):
                return True
    return False
```

The recursion stack (`rec_stack`) tracks the current DFS path. If we encounter a vertex that is
Already on the current path, we've found a back edge → cycle.

For undirected graphs, we additionally check that the back edge doesn't go to the parent vertex.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Incorrectly applying integration by parts by choosing $u$ and $\frac{dv}{dx}$ the wrong way
   around.

2. Confusing the domain and range of functions, or not considering restrictions (e.g., denominator
   cannot be zero).

3. Rounding too early in multi-step calculations. Carry full precision through and round only the
   final answer.

4. Forgetting to check that solutions satisfy the original equation (especially with squaring both
   sides or dividing by variables).
