**Q34.** Explain how RSA encryption works in three sentences.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

RSA uses a public key $(e, n)$ to encrypt: $C = M^e \bmod n$And a private key $(d, n)$ to decrypt:
$M = C^d \bmod n$. The keys are derived from two large primes $p, q$ where $n = pq$ and
$ed \equiv 1 \pmod{(p-1)(q-1)}$. Security relies on the difficulty of factoring $n$ into $p$ and
$q$.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing authentication (who you are) with authorisation (what you can do) in security contexts.

2. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.

3. Misunderstanding the difference between a stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO) in data structure
   applications.

4. Writing pseudocode that is too language-specific rather than using standard algorithmic
   constructs.
