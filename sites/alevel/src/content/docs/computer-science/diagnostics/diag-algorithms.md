## Unit Tests

### UT-1: Big O Notation Analysis

**Question:** Determine the time complexity (in Big O notation) of each code fragment:

```python
## Fragment A
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)

# Fragment B
i = 1
while i < n:
    i = i * 2

# Fragment C
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, j)
```

**Solution:**

Fragment A: The outer loop runs $n$ times. The inner loop runs $n$ times for each iteration of the
outer loop. Total operations $= n \times n = n^2$. **Time complexity: $O(n^2)$.**

Fragment B: $i$ starts at 1 and doubles each iteration: $1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^k$ where $2^k \lt n$.
The loop runs $k$ times where $k = \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$. **Time complexity: $O(\log n)$.**

Fragment C: The outer loop runs $n$ times ($i = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$). The inner loop runs $i$ times
for each value of $i$. Total iterations
$= 0 + 1 + 2 + \ldots + (n-1) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{n^2}{2} - \frac{n}{2}$. Dropping constants
and lower-order terms: **Time complexity: $O(n^2)$.**

Note: Fragment C is approximately half the operations of Fragment A, but both are $O(n^2)$ -- Big O
notation ignores constant factors.

### UT-2: Sorting Algorithm Comparison

**Question:** An array contains the values: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]. (a) Perform the first two
passes of bubble sort (ascending), showing the array after each pass and each swap. (b) How many
comparisons and swaps occur in the first pass? (c) State the best-case, average-case, and worst-case
time complexity of bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

**Solution:**

(a) **Bubble sort, pass 1:**

Starting: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

Compare 38, 27: swap $\to$ [27, 38, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10] Compare 38, 43: no swap $\to$ [27, 38, 43, 3,
9, 82, 10] Compare 43, 3: swap $\to$ [27, 38, 3, 43, 9, 82, 10] Compare 43, 9: swap $\to$ [27, 38,
3, 9, 43, 82, 10] Compare 43, 82: no swap $\to$ [27, 38, 3, 9, 43, 82, 10] Compare 82, 10: swap
$\to$ [27, 38, 3, 9, 43, 10, 82]

After pass 1: [27, 38, 3, 9, 43, 10, 82]. The largest element (82) has bubbled to the end.

**Bubble sort, pass 2:**

Compare 27, 38: no swap Compare 38, 3: swap $\to$ [27, 3, 38, 9, 43, 10, 82] Compare 38, 9: swap
$\to$ [27, 3, 9, 38, 43, 10, 82] Compare 38, 43: no swap Compare 43, 10: swap $\to$ [27, 3, 9, 38,
10, 43, 82]

After pass 2: [27, 3, 9, 38, 10, 43, 82].

(b) Pass 1: $n - 1 = 6$ comparisons. Swaps: 4 (38/27, 43/3, 43/9, 82/10).

(c) Time complexity comparison:

| Algorithm   | Best Case                                  | Average Case  | Worst Case           | Space       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Bubble Sort | $O(n)$ (already sorted, with optimisation) | $O(n^2)$      | $O(n^2)$             | $O(1)$      |
| Merge Sort  | $O(n \log n)$                              | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n \log n)$        | $O(n)$      |
| Quicksort   | $O(n \log n)$                              | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n^2)$ (bad pivot) | $O(\log n)$ |

### UT-3: Binary Search Trace

**Question:** The sorted array is: [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]. Perform a binary search
for the value 23. Show the values of `low``high``mid`And the comparison at each step. How many
comparisons are needed? State the maximum number of comparisons for binary search on an array of
size $n$.

**Solution:**

Array indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Values: [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]

Step 1: low $= 0$High $= 9$. Mid $= (0 + 9) / 2 = 4$. A[4] $= 16$. $16 \lt 23$Search right half.

Step 2: low $= 5$High $= 9$. Mid $= (5 + 9) / 2 = 7$. A[7] $= 56$. $56 \gt 23$Search left half.

Step 3: low $= 5$High $= 6$. Mid $= (5 + 6) / 2 = 5$. A[5] $= 23$. $23 = 23$. Found!

Total comparisons: 3.

Maximum comparisons for binary search on array of size $n$: $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil + 1$ (or
$\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1$ depending on the implementation). For $n = 10$:
$\lceil \log_2 10 \rceil + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5$ maximum comparisons.

## Integration Tests

### IT-1: Algorithm Choice and Data Structure (with Data Structures)

**Question:** A social media application needs to maintain a leaderboard of the top 100 scores from
10 million users, updated in real-time. (a) Which sorting algorithm is most appropriate for
maintaining this leaderboard? Justify your answer. (b) What data structure would you use to
efficiently check if a given score is in the top 100? (c) If the application also needs to support
range queries ("show all users with scores between X and Y"), which data structure would be most
appropriate?

**Solution:**

(a) **Insertion sort** is appropriate for maintaining the top 100 because:

- Only 100 elements need to be maintained, not the full 10 million.
- When a new score arrives, it only needs to be inserted into the correct position among the 100 (if
  it qualifies).
- Insertion into a sorted array of 100 elements takes at most $O(100) = O(1)$ comparisons (constant
  time relative to $n = 10^7$).
- The initial sort of 100 elements is trivial.

Alternatively, a **min-heap** of size 100: the root stores the minimum of the top 100. When a new
score arrives, compare with the root. If greater, replace root and reheapify ($O(\log 100) = O(1)$).
If not, discard. This is the most efficient approach.

(b) A **hash table** with the user ID as key and score as value allows $O(1)$ lookup of any user"s
score. To check if a score is in the top 100, compare against the minimum score in the top 100 (the
root of the min-heap, $O(1)$).

(c) For range queries, a **balanced BST** (AVL tree or red-black tree) keyed by score allows:

- Range queries in $O(\log n + k)$ where $k$ is the number of results.
- In-order traversal to list all scores in a range.
- $O(\log n)$ insertion and deletion.

A **B-tree** (used in databases) would also be excellent for range queries, as it stores data in
sorted order and allows efficient sequential access.

**Combined solution:** Use a min-heap of size 100 for the leaderboard (fast top-100 maintenance), a
hash table for $O(1)$ user score lookup, and a balanced BST for range queries. The hash table and
BST are updated whenever a score changes.

### IT-2: Graph Algorithms and Network Design (with Network Fundamentals)

**Question:** A computer network has 6 routers (A--F) with the following link costs (undirected):
A-B(2), A-C(5), B-C(1), B-D(4), C-D(1), C-E(3), D-E(6), D-F(7), E-F(2). (a) Find the minimum
spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm. (b) Calculate the total cost. (c) If link C-D fails,
recalculate the MST.

**Solution:**

(a) **Kruskal's algorithm** (sort edges by weight):

Edges sorted: B-C(1), C-D(1), A-B(2), E-F(2), C-E(3), B-D(4), A-C(5), D-E(6), D-F(7).

Process:

1. B-C(1): add. Forest: \{B-C\}, \{A\}, \{D\}, \{E\}, \{F\}.
2. C-D(1): add (C connects to D). Forest: \{B-C-D\}, \{A\}, \{E\}, \{F\}.
3. A-B(2): add (A connects to B). Forest: \{A-B-C-D\}, \{E\}, \{F\}.
4. E-F(2): add. Forest: \{A-B-C-D\}, \{E-F\}.
5. C-E(3): add (C connects to E). Forest: \{A-B-C-D-E-F\}. Done (5 edges for 6 vertices).

MST edges: A-B(2), B-C(1), C-D(1), C-E(3), E-F(2).

(b) Total cost: $2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 9$.

(c) If C-D(1) fails, re-run Kruskal's algorithm without this edge:

Edges (sorted, excluding C-D): B-C(1), A-B(2), E-F(2), C-E(3), B-D(4), A-C(5), D-E(6), D-F(7).

1. B-C(1): add. \{B-C\}, \{A\}, \{D\}, \{E\}, \{F\}.
2. A-B(2): add. \{A-B-C\}, \{D\}, \{E\}, \{F\}.
3. E-F(2): add. \{A-B-C\}, \{D\}, \{E-F\}.
4. C-E(3): add. \{A-B-C-E-F\}, \{D\}.
5. B-D(4): add. \{A-B-C-D-E-F\}. Done (5 edges for 6 vertices).

New MST: A-B(2), B-C(1), C-E(3), E-F(2), B-D(4).

Total cost: $2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 12$.

The cost increased from 9 to 12 when link C-D failed, demonstrating the importance of redundant
paths in network design.

### IT-3: Recursive Algorithms and Complexity (with Programming Constructs)

**Question:** The following recursive function computes the nth Fibonacci number:

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

(a) Draw the recursion tree for `fib(5)`. (b) How many times is `fib(2)` called? (c) Explain why the
time complexity is $O(2^n)$ and how memoisation improves it to $O(n)$. (d) Write an iterative
version with $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space complexity.

**Solution:**

(a) Recursion tree for `fib(5)`:

```
                    fib(5)
                   /      \
              fib(4)        fib(3)
             /     \        /     \
         fib(3)   fib(2)  fib(2)  fib(1)
        /     \     |      |       |
    fib(2) fib(1)   1      1       1
      |      |
      1      1
```

(b) `fib(2)` is called 3 times: once from `fib(4)` and once from `fib(3)` on the left, and once from
`fib(3)` on the right. More precisely: in the tree above, `fib(2)` appears at three distinct nodes.

(c) At each level of recursion, the number of function calls approximately doubles (each call spawns
two more, except the base cases). The depth is $n$Giving approximately $2^n$ nodes. More precisely,
the number of calls follows the Fibonacci sequence itself: $T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + 1$Which gives
$T(n) \approx 2 \times \text{fib}(n+1) - 1$Growing as $O(\phi^n)$ where
$\phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.618$. This is commonly stated as $O(2^n)$ as an upper bound.

Memoisation stores the result of `fib(k)` the first time it is computed. Subsequent calls to
`fib(k)` retrieve the stored value in $O(1)$ time. Since there are only $n$ distinct values of
`fib(k)` to compute ($k = 0, 1, \ldots, n$), the total work is $O(n)$.

(d) Iterative version:

```python
def fib_iterative(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    prev2 = 0
    prev1 = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = current
    return prev1
```

Time complexity: $O(n)$ -- one loop iteration per value. Space complexity: $O(1)$ -- only three
variables are used regardless of $n$.

## Common Mistakes

**Confusing time complexity with space complexity:** Big-O notation describes how the time (or space) requirement grows with input size. $O(n)$ means time grows linearly. $O(n^2)$ means time grows quadratically. A common mistake is stating "the algorithm is $O(n)$" without specifying whether you mean time or space — these are different things and must be evaluated separately.

**Off-by-one errors in loop bounds:** When implementing binary search or iterative algorithms, the boundary conditions (whether to use $<$ or $\leq$, and how to update $lo$ and $hi$) are critical. An off-by-one error can cause the algorithm to miss the target or loop forever. Always trace through the smallest input case to verify your bounds.

**Assuming recursion is always more efficient than iteration:** Recursion adds overhead from function call stacking. For problems like Fibonacci, naive recursion gives $O(2^n)$ while iteration gives $O(n)$. Use recursion when it naturally expresses the problem (e.g., tree traversal), but prefer iteration for simple loops.
