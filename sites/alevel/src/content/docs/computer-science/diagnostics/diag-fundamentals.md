# Fundamentals — Diagnostic Tests

## Unit Tests

### UT-1: Two"s Complement and Arithmetic

**Question:** (a) Convert $-97$ to 8-bit two's complement. (b) Perform the addition $(-97) + 45$
using 8-bit two's complement binary. State whether overflow occurs. (c) What is the range of
integers representable in 8-bit two's complement?

**Solution:**

(a) $97 = 01100001_2$. Flip bits: $10011110_2$. Add 1: $10011111_2$.

$-97$ in 8-bit two's complement $= 10011111_2$.

(b) $45 = 00101101_2$.

$$
\begin{array}{r}
 10011111 \\
+ 00101101 \\
\hline
 11001100 \\
\end{array}
$$

$11001100_2$ is a negative number (MSB $= 1$). Convert to decimal: flip bits $= 00110011$Add 1
$= 00110100_2 = 52$. So the result is $-52$.

Check: $-97 + 45 = -52$. Correct.

Overflow: No overflow occurs because a positive and negative number are being added, which can never
produce overflow in two's complement. Overflow can only occur when adding two numbers of the same
sign.

(c) Range: $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1} - 1$. For $n = 8$: $-128$ to $+127$.

### UT-2: Floating Point Representation

**Question:** A floating-point system uses 8 bits: 1 sign bit, 3 exponent bits (excess-4), and 4
mantissa bits. Represent $-5.75$ in this format. Calculate the absolute error and the relative error
as a percentage.

**Solution:**

$5.75 = 5 + 3/4 = 101.11_2$.

Normalise: $1.0111 \times 2^2$.

Sign bit: $1$ (negative).

Exponent: $2$ in excess-4 $= 2 + 4 = 6 = 110_2$.

Mantissa (4 bits after the implicit leading 1): $0111$.

Representation: $1\ 110\ 0111 = 11100111_2$.

Stored value:
$(-1)^1 \times 1.0111_2 \times 2^{110_2 - 100_2} = -1.0111_2 \times 2^2 = -101.11_2 = -(4 + 0 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.25) = -5.75$.

Absolute error: $|{-5.75} - ({-5.75})| = 0$. The representation is exact in this case.

Relative error: $0\%$.

**For comparison, with only 3 mantissa bits:**

Mantissa would be $011$Stored value $= -1.011_2 \times 2^2 = -101.1_2 = -(4 + 1 + 0.5) = -5.5$.

Absolute error $= |-5.5 - (-5.75)| = 0.25$. Relative error $= 0.25 / 5.75 = 4.35\%$.

With 4 mantissa bits, $5.75$ is represented exactly because $5.75 = 101.11_2$ which fits in the
available bits.

### UT-3: Boolean Algebra Simplification

**Question:** Simplify the Boolean expression $F = A\bar{B}C + AB\bar{C} + ABC + \bar{A}BC$. Use
Boolean algebra laws and verify with a Karnaugh map. Draw the logic circuit for the simplified
expression using only NAND gates.

**Solution:**

$F = A\bar{B}C + AB\bar{C} + ABC + \bar{A}BC$

Group $AB\bar{C} + ABC = AB(\bar{C} + C) = AB(1) = AB$.

Group $A\bar{B}C + \bar{A}BC = (A + \bar{A})BC = BC$.

So far: $F = AB + BC + A\bar{B}C$.

Simplify $AB + A\bar{B}C = A(B + \bar{B}C) = A(B + C) = AB + AC$.

Therefore: $F = AB + AC + BC$.

**Karnaugh map verification** (minterms:
$A\bar{B}C = m_5$$AB\bar{C} = m_6$$ABC = m_7$$\bar{A}BC = m_3$):

| AB\C | 0   | 1   |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| 00   | 0   | 0   |
| 01   | 0   | 1   |
| 11   | 1   | 1   |
| 10   | 1   | 1   |

Groups:

- $m_3 + m_7$ (column C=1, B=1): $BC$
- $m_6 + m_7$ (row AB=11, A=1, B=1): $AB$
- $m_5 + m_7$ (column C=1, A=1): $AC$

All three groups are essential prime implicants. $F = AB + AC + BC$Confirming the algebraic result.

**NAND-only implementation:** $F = AB + BC + AC$.

Each AND becomes NAND followed by NAND (as inverter). Each OR becomes NAND.

Using De Morgan's: $F = \overline{\overline{AB} \cdot \overline{BC} \cdot \overline{AC}}$.

This uses three NAND gates for the AND operations (actually, we can use NAND directly since
$\text{NAND}(A,B) = \overline{AB}$), and one NAND gate for the final OR (since
$\overline{\overline{AB} \cdot \overline{CD}} = AB + CD$). Total: 4 NAND gates.

## Integration Tests

### IT-1: Number Systems and Data Representation (with Data Representation in Programming)

**Question:** The 16-bit two's complement number $1111111111101001_2$ is stored in memory at address
$\text{0x1A00}$. (a) What decimal value does it represent? (b) If this represents the count of
characters in a UTF-8 encoded string, how many bytes of memory does the string occupy? (c) If the
string contains only ASCII characters, what is the maximum possible length of the string in
characters?

**Solution:**

(a) $1111111111101001_2$: This is negative (MSB $= 1$).

Flip: $0000000000010110_2$. Add 1: $0000000000010111_2 = 23$.

So the value is $-23$.

A negative value is not a valid character count. The interpretation depends on whether the stored
value is treated as signed or unsigned.

As unsigned:
$1111111111101001_2 = 1 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 + 4096 + 8192 + 16384 + 32768 = 65513$.

As signed 16-bit two's complement: $65513 - 65536 = -23$.

If treated as signed, $-23$ is not a valid count. If interpreted as unsigned: $65513$.

(b) If interpreted as unsigned ($65513$ characters) in UTF-8:

- ASCII characters: 1 byte each
- Extended Latin: 2 bytes
- Other scripts: 3 bytes
- Emoji: 4 bytes

Without knowing the character mix, we cannot determine the exact byte count. If all ASCII: $65513$
bytes. If all 4-byte: $262052$ bytes.

(c) Maximum ASCII characters in a string that occupies this many bytes: $65513$ characters (if
unsigned). If the value is $-23$There is no valid interpretation as a character count.

This question illustrates the importance of choosing the correct representation: using an unsigned
integer for counts avoids the confusion of negative values, while two's complement is essential for
values that can be negative.

### IT-2: Floating Point and Error Propagation (with Measurement/Scientific)

**Question:** A 12-bit floating-point system (1 sign, 5 exponent excess-15, 6 mantissa) stores the
value $0.1$. Calculate: (a) the stored binary representation, (b) the decimal value actually stored,
(c) the absolute and relative error. (d) If 0.1 is added to itself 10 times using this
representation, what is the accumulated error?

**Solution:**

(a) $0.1_{10}$ in binary: $0.1 = 0.0001100110011\ldots_2$ (repeating).

Normalised: $1.100110011\ldots \times 2^{-4}$.

Exponent: $-4$ in excess-15 $= -4 + 15 = 11 = 01011_2$.

Mantissa (6 bits): $100110$ (truncated after the implicit 1).

Sign: $0$ (positive).

Stored: $0\ 01011\ 100110 = 001011100110_2$.

(b) Actual stored value: $1.100110_2 \times 2^{-4}$.

$1.100110_2 = 1 + 1/2 + 0/4 + 0/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 0/64 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.0625 + 0.03125 = 1.59375$.

$1.59375 \times 2^{-4} = 1.59375 / 16 = 0.099609375$.

(c) Absolute error: $|0.1 - 0.099609375| = 0.000390625$.

Relative error: $0.000390625 / 0.1 = 0.00390625 = 0.39\%$.

(d) Adding 0.1 (stored as 0.099609375) ten times:

$10 \times 0.099609375 = 0.99609375$.

Expected: $10 \times 0.1 = 1.0$.

Accumulated error: $|1.0 - 0.99609375| = 0.00390625$.

Note: the error does NOT grow by a factor of 10 -- it stays at $0.00390625$ because we are adding
the same truncated value repeatedly. In practice, floating-point addition at each step introduces
additional rounding errors, so the actual accumulated error would be slightly different.

### IT-3: Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates (with Computer Architecture)

**Question:** A half-adder adds two 1-bit numbers and produces a sum and carry. (a) Derive the
Boolean expressions for sum ($S$) and carry ($C$). (b) Show how two half-adders and an OR gate can
be combined to create a full-adder. (c) For a 4-bit ripple-carry adder, calculate the maximum
propagation delay if each half-adder has a delay of $5\ \text{ns}$ and each OR gate has a delay of
$3\ \text{ns}$.

**Solution:**

(a) Half-adder truth table:

| A   | B   | S   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |

$S = A \oplus B = A\bar{B} + \bar{A}B$ (XOR). $C = AB$ (AND).

(b) Full adder from two half-adders:

First half-adder: inputs $A$$B$. Produces $S_1 = A \oplus B$ and $C_1 = AB$. Second half-adder:
inputs $S_1$$C_{\text{in}}$. Produces
$S = S_1 \oplus C_{\text{in}} = A \oplus B \oplus C_{\text{in}}$ and
$C_2 = S_1 \cdot C_{\text{in}}$. OR gate:
$C_{\text{out}} = C_1 + C_2 = AB + (A \oplus B)C_{\text{in}}$.

(c) For a 4-bit ripple-carry adder: each full-adder must wait for the carry from the previous stage.

Each full-adder uses 2 half-adders (5 ns each) and 1 OR gate (3 ns). But the critical path is the
carry propagation.

Stage 1: $C_{\text{in}} = 0$So $C_2 = S_1 \cdot C_{\text{in}} = 0$ and $C_{\text{out}} = C_1 = AB$.
Carry out is ready after the first half-adder produces $C_1$I.e., 5 ns.

For subsequent stages: the carry-in must propagate through. The longest path for carry:

- HA1 in stage $i$: 5 ns to produce $S_1$ (needed for $C_2$).
- HA2 in stage $i$: 5 ns to produce $C_2 = S_1 \cdot C_{\text{in}}$.
- OR gate: 3 ns for $C_{\text{out}}$.
- Total per stage: $5 + 5 + 3 = 13$ ns.

For 4 stages: $5$ (first stage) $+ 3 \times 13 = 5 + 39 = 44\text{ ns}$.

Maximum propagation delay: $44\text{ ns}$.

## Common Mistakes

**Confusing AND, OR, and XOR gates in truth tables:** AND outputs 1 only when both inputs are 1. OR outputs 1 when at least one input is 1. XOR outputs 1 when inputs are different. Students often mix up OR and XOR, or forget that NAND is the complement of AND. Memorise the truth tables — they are the foundation of all digital logic.

**Forgetting that processors fetch-execute in a cycle:** The fetch-decode-execute cycle repeats for every instruction. Students sometimes describe it as a one-time process. Each instruction goes through: fetch from memory, decode the opcode, execute the operation, store the result, then increment the program counter and fetch the next instruction.

**Confusing volatile and non-volatile memory:** Volatile memory (RAM) loses its contents when power is off. Non-volatile memory (ROM, SSD, HDD) retains data without power. Cache is volatile. This distinction matters when discussing boot processes, data persistence, and memory hierarchy.
