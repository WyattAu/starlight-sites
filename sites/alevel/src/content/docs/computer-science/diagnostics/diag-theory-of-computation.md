# Theory of Computation — Diagnostic Tests

## Unit Tests

### UT-1: Finite State Machine Design

**Question:** Design a finite state machine (FSM) that accepts binary strings containing an even
number of 0s. (a) Draw the state transition diagram. (b) Write the state transition table. (c) Trace
the FSM with the input `10110` and state whether it is accepted.

**Solution:**

(a) **State transition diagram:**

States: S0 (start, even 0s -- accepting), S1 (odd 0s -- rejecting).

Transitions:

- From S0: on 0 $\to$ S1, on 1 $\to$ S0
- From S1: on 0 $\to$ S0, on 1 $\to$ S1

```
     0           1
  +------+      +------+
  |      |      |      |
  v      |1     v      |1
 (S0)* ---1--> (S1) ---1--> (S1)
  ^ 0          ^ 0
  |            |
  +------0-----+
```

More :

```
      1        0
 (S0)* ---> (S0)*    [on 1, stay at S0]
 (S0)* ---> (S1)     [on 0, go to S1]
 (S1)  ---> (S1)     [on 1, stay at S1]
 (S1)  ---> (S0)*    [on 0, go to S0]
```

(b) **State transition table:**

| Current State  | Input 0 | Input 1 |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| S0 (accepting) | S1      | S0      |
| S1 (rejecting) | S0      | S1      |

(c) **Trace with input `10110`:**

| Step | Input | Current State | Next State |
| ---- | ----- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 0    | -     | S0 (start)    | -          |
| 1    | 1     | S0            | S0         |
| 2    | 0     | S0            | S1         |
| 3    | 1     | S1            | S1         |
| 4    | 1     | S1            | S1         |
| 5    | 0     | S1            | S0         |

Final state: S0 (accepting). The string `10110` is **accepted** because it contains two 0s (even
number).

### UT-2: Regular Expressions

**Question:** Write regular expressions for: (a) all binary strings that start with `01`(b) all
binary strings of length exactly 3 that contain at least one `1`(c) all strings over $\{a, b\}$ that
do NOT contain the substring `aba`. For (c), explain why this cannot be done with a standard regular
expression without negation.

**Solution:**

(a) Strings starting with `01`: `01(0|1)*`

This matches: `01``010``011``0101``0110`Etc. The `(0|1)*` allows any binary sequence (including
empty) after the initial `01`.

(b) Strings of length exactly 3 with at least one `1`:

All length-3 binary strings: `(0|1)(0|1)(0|1)` = 8 strings.

Strings with no 1s: `000`.

Strings with at least one 1: all except `000`. Regular expression: `(0|1)(0|1)(0|1)` minus `000`.

Direct approach: enumerate all valid strings: `001|010|011|100|101|110|111`

Compact approach: `(0|1)(0|1)(1|(0(0|1)1))` -- this is getting complex. Simpler:

`((0|1)(0|1)1) | ((0|1)1(0|1)) | (1(0|1)(0|1))` -- covers all positions where 1 appears.

Even simpler: `1(0|1)(0|1) | 0 1(0|1) | 00 1` $= 1(0\|1)^2 \| 01(0\|1) \| 001$.

(c) Strings over $\{a, b\}$ not containing `aba`:

This requires specifying all allowed strings, which is possible but complex. The complement (strings
containing `aba`) has the regular expression: `(a|b)*aba(a|b)*`.

A standard regular expression (without negation) for "not containing aba" can be constructed by
building a DFA for the language and converting to a regular expression. The DFA has states
representing "how much of `aba` we have seen at the end of the string so far":

States: S0 (start, nothing matched), S1 (last char was "a'), S2 (last two chars were 'ab'), dead
state (saw 'aba').

The regex from the DFA (excluding the dead state) is complex but well-defined. The point is that
regular expressions can express any regular language (recognised by a DFA), and "strings not
containing `aba`" is a regular language. However, expressing it directly is cumbersome -- it is much
easier to write the complement `(a|b)*aba(a|b)*` and use negation in implementations that support it
(e.g., regex engines with negative lookahead: `^((?!aba).)*$`).

### UT-3: Turing Machine Trace

**Question:** A Turing machine has the following transition function for adding 1 to a binary number
(stored least significant bit first on the tape, with blanks represented by `_`):

- In state q0, read 0: write 1, move R, go to q_accept
- In state q0, read 1: write 0, move L, stay in q0
- In state q0, read \_: write 1, move R, go to q_accept

Trace the Turing machine with the input `_110_` (representing binary `011` $= 3$). What is the
result? What decimal number does it represent?

**Solution:**

Initial tape: `_ 1 1 0 _` (head on first `1`State q0)

Wait, the number is stored LSB first, so `_110_` represents bits 1, 1, 0 from left to right, which
is binary $011_2 = 3_{10}$.

Tape layout: `[_] [1] [1] [0] [_]` -- but the head position needs clarification. Let me assume the
head starts at the rightmost bit (LSB):

Tape: `1 1 0 _` with head on `0` (the LSB).

Step 1: State q0, read `0`. Write `1`Move R, go to q*accept. Tape: `1 1 1 *`. Head on `\_`.

The machine halts. Result: `111` (LSB first) $= 111_2 = 7_{10}$.

Wait, but `011` $= 3$Adding 1 gives `100` $= 4$. Let me re-examine.

If `110` in LSB-first means: bit 0 $= 1$Bit 1 $= 1$Bit 2 $= 0$. So the number is
$1 \times 2^0 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3$. Adding 1 gives $4 = 100_2$. In
LSB-first: `001`.

Let me retrace with the correct initial tape. The tape stores `110` (LSB first) for the number 3.

Tape: `[1] [1] [0] [_]` with head on position 0 (the LSB, which is `1`).

Step 1: State q0, read `1`. Write `0`Move L, stay in q0. Tape: `[0] [1] [0] [_]`. Head moves left to
position -1.

Step 2: State q0, read `_`. Write `1`Move R, go to q*accept. Tape: `[1] [0] [1] [0] [*]`. Head on
position 0.

Result: `101` (LSB first) $= 1 \times 2^0 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^2 = 1 + 0 + 4 = 5$.

Hmm, that gives 5, not 4. There is an issue with my tape setup. Let me reconsider.

The correct setup: the tape should be `_110_` where the number is between the blanks. Head starts at
the rightmost digit.

Tape: `_ [1] [1] [0] _`

If the head starts at `0` (position 3):

Step 1: q0, read `0`. Write `1`Move R, q*accept. Tape: `* [1] [1] [1] \_`. Result: `111` (MSB first)
$= 7$.

But this is MSB first, not LSB first. In MSB first: `011` $= 3$. Adding 1: `100` $= 4$.

The issue is my initial interpretation. Let me use MSB first:

`011` with head on the LSB (rightmost `1`):

Step 1: q0, read `1`. Write `0`Move L. Tape: `0 1 0`. Head on the middle `1`.

Step 2: q0, read `1`. Write `0`Move L. Tape: `0 0 0`. Head on the `0`.

Step 3: q0, read `0`. Write `1`Move R, q_accept. Tape: `1 0 0`. Head on `0`.

Result: `100` $= 4$. Correct!

The Turing machine correctly adds 1 to the binary number `011` ($= 3$), producing `100` ($= 4$).

## Integration Tests

### IT-1: Regular Languages and FSM (with Programming Constructs)

**Question:** Write a Python function that simulates the FSM from UT-1 (accepts binary strings with
even number of 0s). Then, write a regular expression that matches the same language. Use both to
test the strings `""``"0"``"00"``"101"``"1110"``"01010"`. Compare the time complexity of the FSM
approach vs the regex approach for an input of length $n$.

**Solution:**

```python
def accepts_even_zeros(s):
    state = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '0':
            state = 1 - state
    return state == 0

import re

pattern = re.compile(r'^(1*01*01*)*$')

test_strings = ["", "0", "00", "101", "1110", "01010"]

for s in test_strings:
    fsm_result = accepts_even_zeros(s)
    regex_result = bool(pattern.fullmatch(s))
    print(f"'{s}': FSM={fsm_result}, Regex={regex_result}")
```

Expected output:

```
'': FSM=True, Regex=True
'0': FSM=False, Regex=False
'00': FSM=True, Regex=True
'101': FSM=True, Regex=True
'1110': FSM=False, Regex=False
'01010': FSM=True, Regex=True
```

**Time complexity comparison:**

FSM approach: $O(n)$ -- one pass through the string, $O(1)$ work per character. Memory: $O(1)$ (just
one state variable).

Regex approach: depends on the implementation. For the regex `^(1*01*01*)*$`A naive backtracking
engine could have exponential time in the worst case because the nested `*` operators create many
possible match paths. A DFA-based regex engine (like Google's RE2) compiles the regex to a DFA first
and achieves $O(n)$ matching time, but with potentially exponential compilation time.

The FSM approach is always $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space, making it more predictable and efficient.
For simple validation rules, a hand-coded FSM or state variable is often preferred over regex for
performance-critical applications.

### IT-2: Halting Problem and Decidability (with Software Engineering)

**Question:** (a) State the halting problem and explain the proof by contradiction that it is
undecidable. (b) Explain why a compiler cannot detect all infinite loops in a program. (c) Despite
the halting problem being undecidable, static analysis tools can detect SOME infinite loops. Give an
example of a detectable infinite loop pattern and explain why it does not contradict the halting
problem.

**Solution:**

(a) **Halting problem:** Given an arbitrary program $P$ and input $I$Determine whether $P$ halts
(terminates) when run on $I$.

**Proof by contradiction:** Assume a function `halts(P, I)` exists that returns True if program $P$
halts on input $I$And False otherwise.

Construct a paradoxical program `trouble(P)`:

```
function trouble(P):
    if halts(P, P):
        loop forever
    else:
        halt
```

Now ask: does `trouble(trouble)` halt?

- If `halts(trouble, trouble)` returns True (it halts), then `trouble` loops forever. Contradiction.
- If `halts(trouble, trouble)` returns False (it loops), then `trouble` halts. Contradiction.

Both cases lead to contradictions, so the assumption that `halts` exists is false. The halting
problem is undecidable.

(b) A compiler cannot detect all infinite loops because if it could, it would solve the halting
problem. Specifically, to detect an infinite loop, the compiler would need to determine whether a
program (or part of a program) halts -- which is undecidable. Any compiler that claims to detect all
infinite loops would either miss some (false negatives) or incorrectly flag terminating code as
infinite (false positives).

(c) **Detectable pattern example:** `while True: pass` -- this is an infinite loop because the
condition is a constant `True`.

Another example: `x = 0; while x >= 0: x += 1` -- a static analyser can detect that `x` only
increases and the condition `x >= 0` is always true (for an integer that starts non-negative),
making this loop infinite.

This does NOT contradict the halting problem because: the halting problem says NO algorithm can
decide halting for ALL possible programs. Static analysis tools that detect specific patterns are
correct for those patterns but incomplete -- they cannot detect all infinite loops. The halting
problem only proves that a universal detector is impossible, not that some detectors for some cases
are impossible. There exist infinite loops that no static analyser can detect (e.g., loops whose
termination depends on deep mathematical properties like the Collatz conjecture).

### IT-3: Automata and Complexity Classes (with Complexity Analysis)

**Question:** (a) Design a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that accepts all binary strings
ending in `101`. (b) Design a pushdown automaton (PDA) that accepts the language
$\{a^n b^n : n \geq 0\}$. (c) Explain why the language in (b) cannot be accepted by a DFA. (d) State
which complexity class (P, NP) the following belong to: sorting, graph colouring (decision),
primality testing.

**Solution:**

(a) **DFA for strings ending in `101`:**

States: S0 (start, no relevant suffix), S1 (last char was '1'), S2 (last two chars were '10'), S3
(last three chars were '101' -- accepting).

Transitions:

| From | On 0 | On 1 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| S0   | S0   | S1   |
| S1   | S2   | S1   |
| S2   | S0   | S3   |
| S3\* | S2   | S1   |

Trace with `1101`: S0 $\xrightarrow{1}$ S1 $\xrightarrow{1}$ S1 $\xrightarrow{0}$ S2
$\xrightarrow{1}$ S3\* (accept).

Trace with `1010`: S0 $\xrightarrow{1}$ S1 $\xrightarrow{0}$ S2 $\xrightarrow{1}$ S3\*
$\xrightarrow{0}$ S2 (reject).

(b) **PDA for $\{a^n b^n\}$:**

States: q0 (start), q1 (reading b's, popping), q_accept.

- Start in q0, stack initially empty.
- Read 'a' in q0: push 'a' onto stack, stay in q0.
- Read 'b' in q0 (stack not empty): transition to q1, pop 'a'.
- Read 'b' in q1 (stack not empty): pop 'a', stay in q1.
- Read 'b' in q1 (stack empty): reject (more b's than a's).
- End of input in q1 with empty stack: accept.
- Read 'a' in q1: reject (a after b).

(c) **Why no DFA can accept $a^n b^n$:** A DFA has a finite number of states. For the language
$\{a^n b^n\}$The DFA would need to "remember" exactly how many $a$'s were read to verify the same
number of $b$'s follow. For arbitrary $n$This requires unbounded memory (counting arbitrarily high).
A DFA's finite state set cannot store an arbitrarily large count. This is proven by the pumping
lemma for regular languages: a sufficiently long string in the language can be "pumped" (a substring
repeated) and must remain in the language. For $a^n b^n$Pumping the $a$ section breaks the balance,
producing a string not in the language -- proving it is not regular.

(d) **Complexity classes:**

- **Sorting:** P (polynomial time). Many $O(n \log n)$ algorithms exist (merge sort, quicksort
  average case).
- **Graph colouring (decision version):** NP-complete. Determining if a graph can be coloured with
  $k$ colours is in NP (a valid colouring is a polynomial-time verifiable certificate) and is
  NP-hard (all NP problems reduce to it for $k \geq 3$).
- **Primality testing:** P (since the AKS algorithm, 2002). It was known to be in NP (a certificate
  of compositeness -- a factor -- is verifiable in polynomial time) and was known to be in co-NP,
  and is now known to be in P.

## Common Mistakes

**Confusing decidability with complexity:** A problem being decidable means an algorithm exists that always halts and gives the correct answer. Complexity (P vs NP) is about how fast that algorithm runs. The halting problem is undecidable — no algorithm can solve it for all inputs. Sorting is decidable and in P — a fast algorithm exists.

**Assuming NP means "not solvable in polynomial time":** NP stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time." It means the solution can be verified in polynomial time, not that it cannot be solved in polynomial time. All P problems are also in NP (if you can solve it quickly, you can certainly verify it quickly).

**Confusing regular languages with context-free languages:** Regular languages can be recognised by finite automata (DFA/NFA) and described by regular expressions. Context-free languages require a pushdown automaton (with a stack). The language $a^n b^n$ is context-free but not regular because counting requires unbounded memory, which a finite automaton cannot provide.
