## 1. Positional Number Systems

### Definition

A **positional number system** represents a number as a sequence of digits
$d_{n-1}d_{n-2}\ldots d_1d_0$ in base $b$Where the value of the number is:

$$
N = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i \cdot b^i
$$

Each digit $d_i$ satisfies $0 \leq d_i \lt b$. The **most significant digit** (MSD) is $d_{n-1}$ And
the **least significant digit** (LSD) is $d_0$.

The bases relevant to A Level Computer Science are:

| Base | Name   | Digits Used           |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------- |
| 10   | Denary | 0, 1, 2, ..., 9       |
| 2    | Binary | 0, 1                  |
| 8    | Octal  | 0, 1, 2, ..., 7       |
| 16   | Hex    | 0–9, A, B, C, D, E, F |

We use subscript notation to denote the base: $1011_2 = 11_{10}$.

### Conversion Between Bases

#### Base $b$ to Denary

**Algorithm.** Given digits $d_{n-1}\ldots d_0$ in base $b$Compute:

$$
N = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i \cdot b^i
$$

**Correctness.** This is exactly the definition of positional notation, so correctness is immediate.

**Proof of termination.** The sum has exactly $n$ terms, so the algorithm terminates after $n$
Iterations.

<details>
<summary>Example: Convert $1A3_{16}$ to denary</summary>

$$1 \times 16^2 + 10 \times 16^1 + 3 \times 16^0 = 256 + 160 + 3 = 419_{10}$$

</details>

#### Denary to Base $b$ (Repeated Division)

**Algorithm.** To convert denary $N$ to base $b$:

1. Set $i = 0$
2. While $N \gt 0$: digit $d_i = N \bmod b$; set $N = \lfloor N / b \rfloor$; $i \leftarrow i + 1$
3. The result is $d_{i-1}d_{i-2}\ldots d_0$ (digits collected in reverse order)

**Correctness proof.** We prove by induction on the number of division steps that the algorithm
Produces the correct base-$b$ representation.

_Base case._ After the first step, $d_0 = N \bmod b$ and $N" = \lfloor N / b \rfloor$. We have
$N = d_0 + b \cdot N'$ So $d_0$ is indeed the coefficient of $b^0$.

_Inductive step._ Assume after $k$ steps we have
$N = d_0 + d_1 b + \cdots + d_{k-1}b^{k-1} + b^k \cdot N_k$ where $N_k = \lfloor N / b^k \rfloor$.
The next step computes $d_k = N_k \bmod b$ and $N_{k+1} = \lfloor N_k / b \rfloor$Giving
$N_k = d_k + b \cdot N_{k+1}$. Substituting:

$$N = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i b^i + b^k(d_k + b \cdot N_{k+1}) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i b^i + b^{k+1} N_{k+1}$$

This maintains the invariant. When $N_k = 0$The representation is complete.

<details>
<summary>Example: Convert $156_{10}$ to binary</summary>

| Step | $N$ | $N \bmod 2$ | $\lfloor N/2 \rfloor$ |
| ---- | --- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | 156 | 0           | 78                    |
| 2    | 78  | 0           | 39                    |
| 3    | 39  | 1           | 19                    |
| 4    | 19  | 1           | 9                     |
| 5    | 9   | 1           | 4                     |
| 6    | 4   | 0           | 2                     |
| 7    | 2   | 0           | 1                     |
| 8    | 1   | 1           | 0                     |

Reading bottom to top: $156_{10} = 10011100_2$

</details>

#### Binary to Hexadecimal (and vice versa)

Since $16 = 2^4$Each hex digit corresponds to exactly 4 binary digits. Group binary digits from
Right to left in groups of 4, then convert each group.

<details>
<summary>Example: Convert $10111011011_2$ to hex</summary>

Group: $101\ 1101\ 1011$

Pad left group: $0101\ 1101\ 1011$

Convert: $5\ \mathrm{D}\ \mathrm{B} = 5DB_{16}$

</details>

#### Hexadecimal to Binary

Replace each hex digit with its 4-bit binary equivalent.

<details>
<summary>Example: Convert $3F7_{16}$ to binary</summary>

$3 = 0011$$F = 1111$$7 = 0111$

Result: $001111110111_2 = 11111110111_2$

</details>

#### Octal Conversions

Since $8 = 2^3$Each octal digit maps to exactly 3 binary digits. Convert by grouping in 3s (or
Multiplying/dividing by 8).

<hr />

## 2. Binary Arithmetic

### Binary Addition

We add bitwise from right to left, with carries:

| $A$ | $B$ | $C_{in}$ | Sum | $C_{out}$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- | --------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0        | 0   | 0         |
| 0   | 0   | 1        | 1   | 0         |
| 0   | 1   | 0        | 1   | 0         |
| 0   | 1   | 1        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 0   | 0        | 1   | 0         |
| 1   | 0   | 1        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 1   | 0        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 1   | 1        | 1   | 1         |

**Proposition (Carry propagation).** The carry into bit position $i$ depends only on bits $0$
Through $i-1$.

**Proof.** The carry $C_i$ is defined recursively: $C_0 = 0$ and
$C_{i+1} = (A_i \cdot B_i) + (A_i \cdot C_i) + (B_i \cdot C_i)$. By structural induction on $i$
$C_i$ is a Boolean function of $\{A_0, B_0, \ldots, A_{i-1}, B_{i-1}\}$ only. $\square$

<details>
<summary>Example: Add $1011_2 + 0110_2$</summary>

```
  Carry: 1 1 1 0 0
         1 0 1 1
       + 0 1 1 0
       ---------
       1 0 0 0 1
```

$1011_2 = 11_{10}$$0110_2 = 6_{10}$$10001_2 = 17_{10}$. Correct. ✓

</details>

### Binary Subtraction

Binary subtraction can be performed using two's complement (see below).

<hr />

## 3. Two's Complement Representation

### Motivation

We need a way to represent both positive and negative integers in binary, using a fixed number of
Bits.

### Definition

For an $n$-bit two's complement representation, the range of representable integers is:

$$[-2^{n-1},\ 2^{n-1} - 1]$$

The representation of a non-negative integer $x$ is its standard $n$-bit binary Representation. The
representation of a negative integer $-x$ (where $x \gt 0$) is:

$$\mathrm{TwosComp}_n(-x) = 2^n - x$$

### Derivation: Why $\bar{x} + 1$ Works

**Theorem.** For any $n$-bit positive integer $x$ ($1 \leq x \leq 2^{n-1} - 1$), the two's
Complement representation of $-x$ equals $\bar{x} + 1$ (where $\bar{x}$ is the bitwise NOT of the
$n$-bit representation of $x$ And $+1$ is binary addition).

**Proof.** The $n$-bit representation of $x$ has bits $x_{n-1}\ldots x_0$. The bitwise complement
$\bar{x}$ has bits $\bar{x}_{n-1}\ldots\bar{x}_0$Where $\bar{x}_i = 1 - x_i$. The value of $\bar{x}$
as an unsigned $n$-bit number is:

$$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1 - x_i) \cdot 2^i = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i \cdot 2^i = (2^n - 1) - x$$

Therefore:

$$\bar{x} + 1 = (2^n - 1) - x + 1 = 2^n - x$$

This is exactly the definition of the two's complement of $-x$. $\square$

**Corollary.** Adding $x$ and $-x$ in two's complement yields zero (modulo $2^n$).

**Proof.**

$$x + (\bar{x} + 1) = x + 2^n - x = 2^n$$

In $n$ bits, $2^n$ is represented as $00\ldots0$ with a carry out of bit position $n-1$Which is
Discarded. Hence the result is $0$. $\square$

### Two's Complement Addition and Overflow

When adding two $n$-bit two's complement numbers, the result is correct (modulo $2^n$) if and only
If no overflow occurs.

**Overflow detection rules:**

| Condition                           | Overflow? |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| Positive + Positive = Negative      | Yes       |
| Negative + Negative = Positive      | Yes       |
| Positive + Negative                 | Never     |
| Same signs produce same sign result | No        |

**Formally:** overflow occurs if and only if the carry into the MSB differs from the carry out of
The MSB.

<details>
<summary>Example: Add $-5$ and $3$ in 4-bit two's complement</summary>

$-5 = 1011_2$ (since $2^4 - 5 = 11 = 1011_2$) $3 = 0011_2$

```
  Carry: 1 1 1 1 0
         1 0 1 1
       + 0 0 1 1
       ---------
       1 1 1 0
```

$1110_2$ in two's complement: $-2$. Let us verify: $-5 + 3 = -2$. ✓

No overflow (negative + positive never overflows).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example: Overflow — Add $6$ and $5$ in 4-bit two's complement</summary>

$6 = 0110_2$, $5 = 0101_2$

```
  Carry: 0 1 1 0 0
         0 1 1 0
       + 0 1 0 1
       ---------
       1 0 1 1
```

Result: $1011_2 = -5$ in two's complement. But $6 + 5 = 11$Which is outside the range $[-8, 7]$ For
4 bits. Overflow detected: positive + positive yielded negative. ✓

</details>

:::note
- **AQA:** Requires two's complement for 8-bit and 16-bit numbers.
- **CIE:** Requires two's complement for 8-bit numbers specifically.
- **OCR:** Requires understanding of sign and magnitude as well as two's complement.

## 4. Fixed-Point Binary Representation

### Definition

A **fixed-point** binary number uses a specified number of bits for the integer part and a specified
Number of bits for the fractional part.

For an $n$-bit number with $m$ integer bits and $f$ fractional bits ($n = m + f$):

$$N = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} b_i \cdot 2^i + \sum_{j=1}^{f} b_{m+j-1} \cdot 2^{-j}$$

Where $b_0$ is the LSB of the integer part and $b_{m+f-1}$ is the MSB.

### Range and Precision

For an unsigned fixed-point number with $m$ integer bits and $f$ fractional bits:

- **Range:** $[0,\ 2^m - 2^{-f}]$
- **Precision (resolution):** $2^{-f}$

For signed (two's complement) with $m$ integer bits and $f$ fractional bits:

- **Range:** $[-2^{m-1},\ 2^{m-1} - 2^{-f}]$

<details>
<summary>Example: 8-bit fixed-point with 5 integer bits and 3 fractional bits</summary>

$01101011_2$:

Integer part: $01101_2 = 13_{10}$ Fractional part:
$011_2 = 0 \times 2^{-1} + 1 \times 2^{-2} + 1 \times 2^{-3} = 0.375_{10}$

Value: $13.375_{10}$

Range: $[0,\ 31.875]$Precision: $0.125$

## 5. Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)

### Definition

In **Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)**, each decimal digit (0–9) is represented by its 4-bit binary
Equivalent.

| Decimal | BCD  |
| ------- | ---- |
| 0       | 0000 |
| 1       | 0001 |
| 2       | 0010 |
| ...     | ...  |
| 9       | 1001 |

The codes $1010$ through $1111$ are **invalid** in BCD.

### Properties

- Each decimal digit requires exactly 4 bits (a **nibble**)
- A $k$-digit decimal number requires $4k$ bits in BCD
- BCD is less space-efficient than pure binary: e.g., $999_{10}$ requires 12 bits in BCD but only 10
  bits in pure binary ($1111100111_2$)
- BCD avoids rounding errors in decimal arithmetic — useful in financial systems

:::caution
Is $00010010_2$NOT $1100_2$.

## 6. Character Encoding

### ASCII

The **American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)** is a 7-bit character encoding
Standard representing 128 characters:

- $0$–$31$: Control characters (NUL, BEL, LF, CR, etc.)
- $32$: Space
- $48$–$57$: Digits '0'–'9'
- $65$–$90$: Uppercase letters 'A'–'Z'
- $97$–$122$: Lowercase letters 'a'–'z'

**Key property:** The codes for uppercase and lowercase letters differ by exactly $32$ ($2^5$), so
Bit 5 distinguishes them. Specifically, 'A' = $65$ and 'a' = $97$.

Extended ASCII uses 8 bits (256 characters) but is not standardised — various extensions exist.

### Unicode

**Unicode** is a universal character encoding standard that aims to represent every character from
Every writing system. Key facts:

- Unicode assigns a unique **code point** to each character, written as `U+XXXX` (e.g., 'A' =
  `U+0041`'€' = `U+20AC`)
- As of Unicode 15.0, there are over 149,000 characters across 161 scripts
- Unicode is an abstract standard — it defines code points, not how they are stored in bytes

### UTF-8 Encoding

**UTF-8** is a variable-length encoding of Unicode code points into bytes. It is backward-compatible
With ASCII.

**Encoding rules:**

| Code Point Range       | Binary Pattern                        | Bytes |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `U+0000` – `U+007F`    | `0xxxxxxx`                            | 1     |
| `U+0080` – `U+07FF`    | `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx`                   | 2     |
| `U+0800` – `U+FFFF`    | `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`          | 3     |
| `U+10000` – `U+10FFFF` | `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx` | 4     |

**Properties of UTF-8:**

1. **Self-synchronising:** Any byte can identify whether it is a single-byte character, the start of
   a multi-byte sequence, or a continuation byte. Continuation bytes always start with `10`Start
   bytes start with `11...0`.
2. **ASCII compatible:** All ASCII text is valid UTF-8.
3. **Prefix-free:** No valid UTF-8 sequence is a prefix of another valid sequence.

<details>
<summary>Example: Encode '€' (U+20AC) in UTF-8</summary>

$20AC_{16} = 0010\ 0000\ 1010\ 1100_2$

This falls in the range `U+0800`–`U+FFFF`So it uses 3 bytes: `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`.

Fill in the bits from the code point:

$0010\ 0000\ 1010\ 1100$

Split: $\underbrace{0010}_{x} \underbrace{000010}_{xx} \underbrace{101100}_{xx}$

Result: `11100010 10000010 10101100` = `E2 82 AC` in hex.

## 7. Representing Negative Numbers: Other Methods

### Sign and Magnitude

The MSB represents the sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative), and the remaining bits represent the
Magnitude.

- Range for $n$ bits: $[-(2^{n-1} - 1),\ 2^{n-1} - 1]$
- Two representations of zero: $+0 = 000\ldots0$ and $-0 = 100\ldots0$

:::caution
1. It has two representations of zero
2. Addition requires different logic depending on the signs
3. The range is asymmetric

**Problem 5.** A fixed-point system uses 12 bits: 8 for the integer part and 4 for the fractional
Part. What is the range and precision? Convert $01011010.1010$ to denary.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Precision is $2^{-4}$. Range depends on whether signed or unsigned.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Unsigned range: $[0,\ 255.9375]$Precision: $0.0625$ ($2^{-4}$).

$01011010_2 = 64 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 90_{10}$

$.1010_2 = 0.5 + 0.125 = 0.625_{10}$

</details>

**Problem 6.** Encode the string "Hi!" in ASCII (hex). Then explain how many bytes this would take
In UTF-8.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Look up each character's ASCII code point.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

'H' = 72 = $48_{16}$ = `01001000` 'i' = 105 = $69_{16}$ = `01101001` '!' = 33 = $21_{16}$ =
`00100001`

In ASCII hex: `48 69 21`

Since all code points are below `U+007F`UTF-8 uses 1 byte per character, so 3 bytes total. UTF-8
Encoding is identical to ASCII for these characters.

</details>

**Problem 7.** Encode the character 'ñ' (`U+00F1`) in UTF-8. Show each step.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

`U+00F1` falls in the 2-byte range `U+0080`–`U+07FF`. Use the pattern `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

$00F1_{16} = 0000\ 1111\ 0001_2$

Split into bits: $\underbrace{00011}_{x} \underbrace{110001}_{xx}$

First byte: `110` + `00011` = `11000011` = $C3_{16}$ Second byte: `10` + `110001` = `10110001` =
$B1_{16}$

UTF-8: `C3 B1`

</details>

**Problem 8.** A student claims that $1101_2$ in 4-bit two's complement represents $-3$. Another
Claims it represents $+13$. Who is correct? Explain.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

What does the MSB tell you in two's complement?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The first student is correct for two's complement interpretation. The MSB is 1, so it is negative.

Value: $- (2^4 - 13) = -(16 - 13) = -3$. ✓

The second student is interpreting it as an unsigned number: $8 + 4 + 1 = 13$. This is also valid —
The bit pattern is the same, but the interpretation differs. Context determines which encoding is
Used.

</details>

**Problem 9.** Prove that the two's complement of the two's complement of $x$ equals $x$ (for $x$ in
The valid range, excluding $-2^{n-1}$).

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Start with $\mathrm{TwosComp}(x) = 2^n - x$. Apply the operation again.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Let $y = \mathrm{TwosComp}_n(x) = 2^n - x$.

$\mathrm{TwosComp}_n(y) = 2^n - y = 2^n - (2^n - x) = x$. ✓

The exception is $x = -2^{n-1}$Whose two's complement is
$2^n - (-2^{n-1}) = 2^n + 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1} \cdot 3$Which exceeds $n$ bits. In $n$-bit arithmetic,
$2^n - (-2^{n-1}) \bmod 2^n = 2^{n-1}$Which is the bit pattern $100\ldots0$ — the same as
$-2^{n-1}$. So $-2^{n-1}$ is its own two's complement.

</details>

**Problem 10.** In a system using 6-bit two's complement, what is the result of adding $-16$ and
$-15$? Does overflow occur?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Range of 6-bit two's complement is $[-32, 31]$. Compute $-16 + (-15) = -31$. Is this in range?

$-16 = 2^6 - 16 = 48 = 110000_2$ $-15 = 2^6 - 15 = 49 = 110001_2$

```
  1 1 0 0 0 0
+ 1 1 0 0 0 1
-----------
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
```

6-bit result: $100001_2$. This is $-(2^6 - 33) = -31$.

Check: $-16 + (-15) = -31$. No overflow: $-31$ is in range $[-32, 31]$. ✓

Both inputs are negative and the result is negative, so no overflow.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that $O(n \log n)$ average-case for quicksort becomes $O(n^2)$ worst-case on already
   sorted input.

2. Mixing up Big O, Big $\Omega$, and Big $\Theta$ notation. Big O is an upper bound, not
   necessarily tight.

3. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).

4. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.
