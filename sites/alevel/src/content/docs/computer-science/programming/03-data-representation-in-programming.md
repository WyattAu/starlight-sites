## 1. Primitive Types and Their Representation

### Integer Representation

Programming languages provide integer types of various sizes:

| Type  | Size    | Range (signed)        | Range (unsigned) |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| byte  | 8 bits  | $[-128, 127]$         | $[0, 255]$       |
| short | 16 bits | $[-32768, 32767]$     | $[0, 65535]$     |
| int   | 32 bits | $[-2^{31}, 2^{31}-1]$ | $[0, 2^{32}-1]$  |
| long  | 64 bits | $[-2^{63}, 2^{63}-1]$ | $[0, 2^{64}-1]$  |

Python integers have arbitrary precision — they grow to accommodate any value, limited only by
Available memory.

### Floating-Point Representation

IEEE 754 double precision (64 bits): 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits, 52 mantissa bits.

**Precision issues:**

```python
>>> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
>>> 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
False
```

**Why:** $0.1$ cannot be represented exactly in binary floating point (like $1/3$ cannot be
Represented exactly in decimal).

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
A small tolerance (e.g., `1e-9`).

```python
def approx_equal(a, b, epsilon=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < epsilon
```

</aside>

## 2. Pointers and References

### Definition

A **pointer** is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable. A **reference**
Is an alias for an existing variable.

### Pointers in Low-Level Languages

```c
int x = 42;
int *ptr = &x;    // ptr stores the address of x
*ptr = 10;        // dereference: change x to 10
```

### Python"s Model: References, Not Pointers

Python does not have explicit pointers. Variables are **references** to objects in memory.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a       # b references the SAME list object
b[0] = 99
print(a)    # [99, 2, 3] — a is also modified!
```

**Key distinction:**

| Operation                           | Effect                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `b = a`                             | `b` references the same object as `a`  |
| `b = a.copy()`                      | `b` references a new, independent copy |
| `b = list(a)`                       | Same as `a.copy()`                     |
| `import copy; b = copy.deepcopy(a)` | Deep copy (copies nested objects)      |

### Aliasing

**Aliasing** occurs when two variables reference the same object. This can lead to unintended side
Effects.

```python
def append_one(lst):
    lst.append(1)     # Modifies the original list!

my_list = [0]
append_one(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [0, 1]
```

<hr />

## 3. Strings

### Definition

A **string** is a sequence of characters. Internally, strings are represented as arrays of character
Codes (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).

### String Operations and Complexity

| Operation        | Python method  | Time                              |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Access character | `s[i]`         | $O(1)$                            |
| Length           | `len(s)`       | $O(1)$                            |
| Concatenation    | `s1 + s2`      | $O(n+m)$                          |
| Substring search | `s1 in s2`     | $O(nm)$ naive, $O(n+m)$ optimized |
| Split            | `s.split(sep)` | $O(n)$                            |
| Slice            | `s[a:b]`       | $O(b-a)$                          |

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
`s[0] = 'x'` raises a `TypeError`. Use `s = 'x' + s[1:]` to create a new string.
</aside>
### String Immutability

Strings are immutable for several reasons:

1. **Security:** Prevents sensitive data from being modified in memory
2. **Thread safety:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe
3. **Hashing:** Immutable strings can be used as dictionary keys (hash is stable)
4. **Interning:** Python can reuse identical string objects, saving memory

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
(pixels, colour depth, resolution), sound sampling (sample rate, bit depth). **CIE (9618)** covers
Similar topics but may emphasise different aspects; requires understanding of file sizes and
Capacity calculations. **OCR (A)** requires character encoding, image representation, and sound
Representation with specific detail on compression (lossy vs lossless). **Edexcel** covers data
Representation fundamentals including number systems and character encoding.

## 4. File Handling

### File Modes

| Mode   | Description  | Creates? | Truncates? |
| ------ | ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| `'r'`  | Read         | No       | No         |
| `'w'`  | Write        | Yes      | Yes        |
| `'a'`  | Append       | Yes      | No         |
| `'r+'` | Read + Write | No       | No         |

### Reading Files

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()         # Entire file as string
    lines = f.readlines()      # List of lines
```

### Writing Files

```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!\n")
    f.writelines(["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n"])
```

### CSV Files

```python
import csv

with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 25])
```

### The `with` Statement

The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs during file
Operations. This is an example of **context management**.

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
# File is automatically closed here
```

<hr />

## 5. Exception Handling

### Definition

An **exception** is an event that disrupts the normal flow of program execution. **Exception
Handling** allows a program to detect and recover from errors gracefully.

### Structure

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
    print(f"Type/Value error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
else:
    print("No exceptions occurred")
finally:
    print("This always runs")
```

### Exception Hierarchy

```
BaseException
├── SystemExit
├── KeyboardInterrupt
├── GeneratorExit
└── Exception
    ├── ArithmeticError
    │   ├── ZeroDivisionError
    │   └── OverflowError
    ├── LookupError
    │   ├── IndexError
    │   └── KeyError
    ├── TypeError
    ├── ValueError
    ├── FileNotFoundError
    └── ...
```

### Best Practices

1. **Catch specific exceptions**, not bare `except:`
2. **Use `finally`** for cleanup (closing files, releasing resources)
3. **Don't use exceptions for normal flow control**
4. **Raise exceptions** for truly exceptional conditions

```python
def set_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError(f"Age cannot be negative: {age}")
    self._age = age
```

### Custom Exceptions

```python
class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, balance, amount):
        self.balance = balance
        self.amount = amount
        super().__init__(f"Insufficient funds: balance={balance}, requested={amount}")
```

## Problem Set

**Problem 1.** Explain why `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` in most programming languages. What is the binary
Representation of 0.1?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

$0.1$ in binary: $0.1_{10} = 0.0001100110011\ldots_2$ (repeating). This cannot be represented
Exactly in a finite number of binary digits. The IEEE 754 double-precision representation stores an
Approximation, which introduces a small rounding error. When $0.1$ and $0.2$ (both approximations)
Are added, the result is $0.30000000000000004$Not exactly $0.3$.

Solution: use `abs(a - b) < 1e-9` for comparison, or use the `decimal` module for exact decimal
Arithmetic.

</details>

**Problem 2.** What is the output of the following code? Explain.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b.append(4)
print(a)
print(a is b)
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
True
```

`b = a` makes `b` reference the same list object as `a` (aliasing). Modifying `b` also modifies `a`.
`a is b` returns `True` because they reference the same object.

To avoid this: `b = a.copy()` or `b = a[:]`.

</details>

**Problem 3.** Write a function that reads a file and counts the occurrences of each word. Handle
The case where the file does not exist.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```python
from collections import Counter

def count_words(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            content = f.read().lower()
            words = content.split()
            return Counter(words)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")
        return {}
```

</details>

**Problem 4.** Explain the difference between shallow copy and deep copy. Give an example where they
Produce different results.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Shallow copy:** Creates a new container but fills it with references to the same objects as the
Original.

**Deep copy:** Recursively copies all objects, creating entirely independent copies.

```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
shallow = copy.copy(original)
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

original[0][0] = 99

print(shallow)  # [[99, 2], [3, 4]] — modified!
print(deep)     # [[1, 2], [3, 4]]   — unchanged
```

The shallow copy shares the inner lists with the original. The deep copy has independent inner
Lists.

</details>

**Problem 5.** Write a function that safely divides two numbers, handling division by zero and
Non-numeric input.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```python
def safe_divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = float(a) / float(b)
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        return "Error: Non-numeric input"
```

</details>

**Problem 6.** Explain why strings are immutable in Python. What are the advantages and
Disadvantages?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Advantages:**

1. **Thread safety:** No locks needed for string operations
2. **Hash stability:** Strings can be dictionary keys (hash doesn't change)
3. **Security:** Sensitive data (passwords) cannot be modified after creation
4. **Interning:** Python can reuse identical string objects, saving memory
5. **Simplicity:** No confusion about whether `s[0] = 'x'` modifies the original or a copy

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Memory overhead:** Every modification creates a new string object
2. **Performance:** Concatenation in a loop is $O(n^2)$ without optimisation

```python
# Inefficient: O(n^2) — creates new string each iteration
s = ""
for i in range(1000):
    s += str(i)

# Efficient: O(n) — use join
s = "".join(str(i) for i in range(1000))
```

**Problem 7.** A bitmap image has a resolution of $1920 \times 1080$ pixels and uses 24-bit colour
Depth. Calculate the uncompressed file size in MB (using $1 \mathrm{ MB} = 1024^2$ bytes). If
Lossless compression achieves a 3:1 ratio, what is the compressed file size in MB?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Uncompressed:**

$\mathrm{File size} = \mathrm{width} \times \mathrm{height} \times \mathrm{colour depth}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 1920 \times 1080 \times 24 \mathrm{ bits} = 49,766,400 \mathrm{ bits}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 49,766,400 \div 8 = 6,220,800 \mathrm{ bytes}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 6,220,800 \div 1024^2 \approx 5.93 \mathrm{ MB}$

**With 3:1 compression:**

$\mathrm{Compressed size} = 5.93 \div 3 \approx 1.98 \mathrm{ MB}$

</details>

**Problem 8.** An audio file is recorded at a sample rate of $44,100 \mathrm{ Hz}$ with a bit depth
Of 16 bits, for a duration of 3 minutes in stereo (2 channels). Calculate the file size in MB (using
$1 \mathrm{ MB} = 1024^2$ bytes).

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

$\mathrm{File size} = \mathrm{sample rate} \times \mathrm{bit depth} \times \mathrm{channels} \times \mathrm{duration}$

$\mathrm{Duration} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \mathrm{ seconds}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 44,100 \times 16 \times 2 \times 180 \mathrm{ bits}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 254,016,000 \mathrm{ bits}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 254,016,000 \div 8 = 31,752,000 \mathrm{ bytes}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 31,752,000 \div 1024^2 \approx 30.28 \mathrm{ MB}$

</details>

**Problem 9.** A text file contains the string `"Hello, 世界!"` (9 characters). ASCII uses 7 bits
Per character. UTF-8 uses 1 byte for ASCII characters and 3 bytes for CJK characters. Calculate the
Storage required in bytes for both encodings. Why is Unicode necessary?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**ASCII:** ASCII can only represent 128 characters (0–127) and cannot encode `"世界"`. The ASCII
Encoding would either produce an error or replace each CJK character with a placeholder (e.g., `?`).
If we consider only the encodable characters (`"Hello, !"`), that is 7 characters at 1 byte each = 7
Bytes. The CJK characters cannot be stored.

**UTF-8:**

| Character                                 | Bytes                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| H, e, l, l, o, , space, ! (8 ASCII chars) | 1 byte each = 8 bytes |
| 世                                        | 3 bytes               |
| 界                                        | 3 bytes               |

$\mathrm{Total} = 8 + 3 + 3 = 14 \mathrm{ bytes}$

**Why Unicode is needed:** ASCII only defines 128 characters, covering basic Latin letters, digits,
And symbols. It cannot represent characters from other scripts (Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.),
Mathematical symbols, or emoji. Unicode provides a universal character set of over 149,000
Characters across 161 scripts, ensuring every character in every language can be uniquely encoded.
UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII, so existing ASCII text works without modification while
Gaining support for all other scripts.

</details>

**Problem 10.** A system stores 1000 images at 4K resolution ($3840 \times 2160$) with 32-bit colour
Depth. Calculate the total storage required in GB (using $1 \mathrm{ GB} = 1024^3$ bytes). If
Lossless compression achieves a 2:1 ratio, what is the compressed total size in GB?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Uncompressed size of one image:**

$\mathrm{File size} = 3840 \times 2160 \times 32 \mathrm{ bits} = 265,420,800 \mathrm{ bits}$

$\mathrm{File size} = 265,420,800 \div 8 = 33,177,600 \mathrm{ bytes}$

$\mathrm{File size in GB} = 33,177,600 \div 1024^3 \approx 0.0309 \mathrm{ GB}$

**Total for 1000 images:**

$\mathrm{Total} = 0.0309 \times 1000 = 30.9 \mathrm{ GB}$

**With 2:1 lossless compression:**

$\mathrm{Compressed total} = 30.9 \div 2 \approx 15.45 \mathrm{ GB}$

**Working directly with bytes:**

$\mathrm{One image} = 33,177,600 \mathrm{ bytes}$

$\mathrm{1000 images} = 33,177,600,000 \mathrm{ bytes}$

$\mathrm{In GB} = 33,177,600,000 \div 1024^3 \approx 30.9 \mathrm{ GB}$

$\mathrm{Compressed} = 30.9 \div 2 \approx 15.45 \mathrm{ GB}$

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).

2. Mixing up Big O, Big $\Omega$, and Big $\Theta$ notation. Big O is an upper bound, not
   necessarily tight.

3. Writing pseudocode that is too language-specific rather than using standard algorithmic
   constructs.

4. Misunderstanding the difference between a stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO) in data structure
   applications.
