## 1. Finite State Machines (FSM)

### Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)

**Formal definition.** A DFA is a 5-tuple $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where:

- $Q$ is a finite set of **states**
- $\Sigma$ is a finite **alphabet** (input symbols)
- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ is the **transition function**
- $q_0 \in Q$ is the **start state**
- $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of **accepting (final) states**

**Language accepted:** $L(M) = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid \hat{\delta}(q_0, w) \in F\}$

Where $\hat{\delta}$ is the extended transition function (processes entire string).

### Example: DFA that accepts strings ending in "01"

$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where:

- $Q = \{S, A, B\}$ (S = start, A = saw 0, B = saw 01)
- $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
- $F = \{B\}$

|       | 0   | 1   |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| **S** | A   | S   |
| **A** | A   | B   |
| **B** | A   | S   |

Trace for "1101": S → S → A → B. Accepted. ✓

Trace for "1001": S → S → A → S → A →... Wait, let me retrace.

"1001": S -(1)→ S -(0)→ A -(0)→ A -(1)→ B. Accepted. ✓

### Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)

**Formal definition.** An NFA is a 5-tuple $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where:

- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ (maps to a **set** of states, not a single state)
- All other components are the same as a DFA

An NFA **accepts** a string if there exists at least one path through the machine that ends in an
Accepting state.

### NFA with Epsilon Transitions (ε-NFA)

An ε-NFA additionally allows transitions on the empty string ε (changing state without consuming
Input).

$\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\}) \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$

<hr />

## 2. DFA-NFA Equivalence

**Theorem (Rabin-Scott).** For every NFA $N$There exists a DFA $D$ such that $L(N) = L(D)$. DFAs And
NFAs accept exactly the same class of languages (the **regular languages**).

**Proof (subset construction).** Given NFA $N = (Q_N, \Sigma, \delta_N, q_0, F_N)$Construct DFA
$D = (Q_D, \Sigma, \delta_D, q_0", F_D)$:

1. $Q_D = \mathcal{P}(Q_N)$ (states are subsets of $Q_N$)
2. $q_0' = \varepsilon\mathrm{-closure}(\{q_0\})$
3. $\delta_D(S, a) = \varepsilon\mathrm{-closure}\left(\bigcup_{q \in S} \delta_N(q, a)\right)$ for
   $S \subseteq Q_N$
4. $F_D = \{S \subseteq Q_N \mid S \cap F_N \neq \emptyset\}$

The DFA tracks the set of all states the NFA could be in. Since $Q_N$ is finite, $Q_D$ is finite (at
Most $2^{|Q_N|}$ states). The DFA accepts exactly the same strings as the NFA. $\square$

**Corollary.** The class of regular languages is closed under union, intersection, complementation,
Concatenation, and Kleene star.

## 3. Regular Expressions

### Definition

A **regular expression** defines a regular language using operators:

| Operator      | Name          | Meaning                          | Regex  |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ |
| $\emptyset$   | Empty set     | Accepts nothing                  | —      |
| $\varepsilon$ | Empty string  | Accepts the empty string         | `ε`    |
| $a$           | Literal       | Accepts the character $a$        | `a`    |
| $R \cdot S$   | Concatenation | Strings from $R$ followed by $S$ | `RS`   |
| $R \mid S$    | Alternation   | Strings from $R$ or $S$          | `R\|S` |
| $R^*$         | Kleene star   | Zero or more repetitions of $R$  | `R*`   |

**Kleene's Theorem.** A language is regular if and only if it can be described by a regular
Expression.

### Examples

| Language                       | Regular Expression |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Strings containing "abc"       | `.*(abc).*`        |
| Binary strings ending in "01"  | `(0\|1)*01`        |
| Strings of even length         | `((0\|1)(0\|1))*`  |
| Strings with no consecutive 1s | `(0\|10)*(1\|ε)`   |

### Limitations of Regular Languages

**Theorem.** The language $L = \{a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0\}$ is **not** regular.

**Proof (Pumping Lemma).** The Pumping Lemma for regular languages states: if $L$ is regular, then
There exists a pumping length $p$ such that any string $s \in L$ with $|s| \geq p$ can be split into
$s = xyz$ where:

1. $|xy| \leq p$
2. $|y| \geq 1$
3. $xy^iz \in L$ for all $i \geq 0$

Choose $s = a^p b^p$. By condition 1, $y$ consists only of $a$'s. Pumping ($i = 0$):
$xz = a^{p-|y|}b^p$. Since $|y| \geq 1$, $p - |y| \neq p$So $a^{p-|y|}b^p \notin L$. Contradiction.
$\square$

<hr />

## 4. Turing Machines

### Definition

A **Turing machine (TM)** is a 7-tuple
$M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$ where:

- $Q$ is a finite set of states
- $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet (does not include the blank symbol)
- $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet ($\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$Includes blank symbol $\sqcup$)
- $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$ is the transition function
- $q_0$ is the start state
- $q_{accept}$ is the accept state
- $q_{reject}$ is the reject state ($q_{reject} \neq q_{accept}$)

### Operation

1. Tape is infinite in both directions, initialised with input followed by blanks
2. Read/write head starts at the leftmost input symbol
3. At each step: read the current symbol, consult $\delta$Write a symbol, move head left or right
4. Accept if $q_{accept}$ is reached; reject if $q_{reject}$ is reached; may loop forever

### Example: TM that accepts $L = \{a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0\}$

**Algorithm:**

1. If tape is empty, accept
2. Find the leftmost `a`Replace with `X`Move right to find the leftmost `b`Replace with `X`
3. Return to the leftmost remaining `a`
4. Repeat until no `a` remains
5. If only `X`'s and blanks remain, accept; otherwise reject

**Formal transitions (partial):**

| State | Read     | Write    | Move | Next State   |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | ---- | ------------ |
| $q_0$ | $a$      | $X$      | $R$  | $q_1$        |
| $q_0$ | $X$      | $X$      | $R$  | $q_3$        |
| $q_0$ | $\sqcup$ | $\sqcup$ | $S$  | $q_{accept}$ |
| $q_1$ | $a$      | $a$      | $R$  | $q_1$        |
| $q_1$ | $X$      | $X$      | $R$  | $q_1$        |
| $q_1$ | $b$      | $X$      | $L$  | $q_2$        |
| $q_2$ | $a$      | $a$      | $L$  | $q_2$        |
| $q_2$ | $X$      | $X$      | $R$  | $q_0$        |
| $q_3$ | $X$      | $X$      | $R$  | $q_3$        |
| $q_3$ | $\sqcup$ | $\sqcup$ | $S$  | $q_{accept}$ |
| $q_3$ | $b$      | $b$      | $S$  | $q_{reject}$ |

<hr />

## 5. The Church-Turing Thesis

**Thesis (not provable — a thesis):** Every effectively computable function is computable by a
Turing machine.

Equivalently: any reasonable model of computation (lambda calculus, μ-recursive functions, modern
Programming languages) can compute exactly the same set of functions as a Turing machine.

This is a **thesis**, not a theorem — it cannot be proven because "effectively computable" is an
Informal concept. However, no counterexample has ever been found.

<hr />

## 6. The Halting Problem

### Definition

**Halting problem:** Given a description of a Turing machine $M$ and an input $w$Determine whether
$M$ halts (accepts or rejects) when run on $w$.

**Theorem (Turing, 1936).** The halting problem is **undecidable** — no Turing machine can solve it
For all possible inputs.

### Proof by Contradiction

Assume a Turing machine $H$ exists that decides the halting problem:

$$H(M, w) = \begin{cases} \mathrm{accept} & \mathrm{if } M \mathrm{ halts on } w \\ \mathrm{reject} & \mathrm{if } M \mathrm{ does not halt on } w \end{cases}$$

Construct a new machine $D$ that uses $H$:

$$D(M) = \begin{cases} \mathrm{loop forever} & \mathrm{if } H(M, M) = \mathrm{accept} \\ \mathrm{halt (reject)} & \mathrm{if } H(M, M) = \mathrm{reject} \end{cases}$$

**The contradiction:** What happens when $D$ is run on its own description, $D$?

- If $D(D)$ halts → $H(D, D)$ accepted → $D$ should loop forever → **contradiction**
- If $D(D)$ loops forever → $H(D, D)$ rejected → $D$ should halt → **contradiction**

Both cases lead to contradictions, so $H$ cannot exist. $\square$

**Corollary.** The halting problem is semi-decidable (recursively enumerable): we can build a
Machine that accepts when $M$ halts on $w$But it cannot always reject when $M$ doesn't halt (it
Would have to run forever).

## 7. Decidable and Undecidable Problems

| Category       | Definition                                            | Example                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Decidable      | A TM always halts with the correct answer             | "Is $n$ prime?"        |
| Semi-decidable | A TM halts on yes-instances; may loop on no-instances | Halting problem        |
| Undecidable    | No TM can solve it for all inputs                     | Halting problem (full) |
| Unrecognisable | No TM even semi-decides it                            | Complement of halting  |

<hr />

## 8. P vs NP

### Definitions

- **P:** The class of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in **polynomial
  time** $O(n^k)$ for some constant $k$.
- **NP:** The class of decision problems whose **yes-instances** can be **verified** by a
  deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time (given a certificate).

### Relationship

$$\mathrm{P} \subseteq \mathrm{NP}$$

Every problem in P is also in NP (if you can solve it in polynomial time, you can certainly verify a
Solution in polynomial time).

**The P vs NP question:** Is $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}$? This is one of the seven Millennium Prize
Problems. Most computer scientists believe $\mathrm{P} \neq \mathrm{NP}$.

### NP-Complete Problems

A problem is **NP-complete** if:

1. It is in NP
2. Every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time

**Examples of NP-complete problems:**

- Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
- Travelling Salesman Problem (decision version)
- Graph colouring
- Knapsack problem
- Subset sum

**Implication:** If **any** NP-complete problem is in P, then $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}$.

### Examples of Problems in P

| Problem                  | Complexity          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Sorting                  | $O(n \log n)$       |
| Shortest path (Dijkstra) | $O((V+E)\log V)$    |
| MST (Kruskal/Prim)       | $O(E \log V)$       |
| String matching          | $O(nm)$ or $O(n+m)$ |
| 2-SAT                    | $O(n + m)$          |

### Examples of Problems in NP (not known to be in P)

| Problem           | Verification                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| SAT               | Verify assignment in $O(n)$  |
| TSP (decision)    | Verify tour length in $O(n)$ |
| Sudoku (n×n)      | Verify solution in $O(n^2)$  |
| Graph 3-colouring | Verify colouring in $O(V+E)$ |

## Problem Set

**Problem 1.** Design a DFA that accepts all binary strings containing an even number of 0s. Give
The formal definition and draw the transition table.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where:

- $Q = \{q_0, q_1\}$ ($q_0$ = even 0s seen, $q_1$ = odd 0s seen)
- $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
- $q_0$ is start state
- $F = \{q_0\}$ (accept when even number of 0s)

|         | 0     | 1     |
| ------- | ----- | ----- |
| → $q_0$ | $q_1$ | $q_0$ |
| $q_1$   | $q_0$ | $q_1$ |

Trace "110": $q_0 \to q_0 \to q_0 \to q_0$. Accept (0 zeros, even). ✓ Trace "101":
$q_0 \to q_0 \to q_1 \to q_1$. Reject (1 zero, odd). ✓

</details>

**Problem 2.** Convert the following NFA to a DFA using the subset construction.

NFA: States $\{0, 1, 2\}$Alphabet $\{a, b\}$Start state 0, accepting state 2.

| From | Input | To     |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 0    | a     | {0, 1} |
| 0    | b     | {0}    |
| 1    | a     | ∅      |
| 1    | b     | {2}    |
| 2    | a     | ∅      |
| 2    | b     | ∅      |

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

DFA states (subsets of {0, 1, 2}):

Start: $\{0\}$

From $\{0\}$: a → {0, 1}, b → {0} From $\{0, 1\}$: a → δ(0,a) ∪ δ(1,a) = {0,1} ∪ ∅ = {0,1}; b →
δ(0,b) ∪ δ(1,b) = {0} ∪ {2} = {0,2} From $\{0, 2\}$: a → δ(0,a) ∪ δ(2,a) = {0,1} ∪ ∅ = {0,1}; b →
δ(0,b) ∪ δ(2,b) = {0} ∪ ∅ = {0} From ∅: a → ∅, b → ∅

Accepting states: any subset containing 2 → $\{0, 2\}$.

| DFA State   | a           | b           | Accept? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| → $\{0\}$   | $\{0,1\}$   | $\{0\}$     | No      |
| $\{0,1\}$   | $\{0,1\}$   | $\{0,2\}$   | No      |
| $\{0,2\}$   | $\{0,1\}$   | $\{0\}$     | Yes     |
| $\emptyset$ | $\emptyset$ | $\emptyset$ | No      |

</details>

**Problem 3.** Write a regular expression for the language of all binary strings that do NOT contain
The substring "11".

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Any such string is a sequence of blocks, where each block is either `0``10`Or `1` (but the last `1`
must not be followed by another `1`).

Regular expression: `(0|10)*(1|ε)`

Explanation:

- `(0|10)*` matches zero or more blocks of "0" or "10" (each 1 is followed by 0)
- `(1|ε)` allows an optional trailing 1 (not followed by another 1)

Verification:

- "" → matches `(1|ε)` with ε. ✓
- "0" → matches `(0|10)*(1|ε)` with "0" and ε. ✓
- "1" → matches `(0|10)*(1|ε)` with empty and "1". ✓
- "10" → matches with "10" and ε. ✓
- "0101" → matches with "0", "10", "1"... Wait: "0101" = "0" + "10" + "1". ✓
- "11" → cannot match (no way to have two consecutive 1s). ✓
</details>

**Problem 4.** Use the Pumping Lemma to prove that $L = \{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$ is not regular.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Assume $L$ is regular. Let $p$ be the pumping length. Choose $s = 0^p 1 0^p 1$ (this is $w = 0^p1$
$ww = 0^p10^p1$). Note $|s| = 2p + 2 \geq p$. ✓

By the Pumping Lemma, $s = xyz$ with $|xy| \leq p$ and $|y| \geq 1$.

Since $|xy| \leq p$, $y$ consists entirely of 0s from the first half. Say $y = 0^k$ where
$1 \leq k \leq p$.

Pump with $i = 0$: $xz = 0^{p-k}10^p1$.

Is this in $L$? It would need to be $ww$ for some $w$. The length is $2p - k + 2$Which is odd when
$k$ is odd, so it cannot be $ww$ (which always has even length). But even when $k$ is even, the
First half is $0^{(p-k/2)+1}$... Actually, for $xz = 0^{p-k}10^p1$ to be in $L = \{ww\}$We need The
first half to equal the second half. The total length is $2p + 2 - k$. The first half is the First
$p + 1 - k/2$ characters: $0^{p-k}1$. The second half is: $0^{k/2}0^p1 = 0^{p+k/2}1$. For These to
be equal, $p-k = p+k/2$Giving $k = -k/2$So $k = 0$. But $k \geq 1$. Contradiction. ✓

Therefore, $L$ is not regular. $\square$

</details>

**Problem 5.** Describe a Turing machine that decides whether a binary string is a palindrome (reads
The same forwards and backwards).

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Algorithm:**

1. Read the leftmost symbol, remember it
2. Move right to the rightmost non-blank symbol
3. Compare: if they differ, reject; if same, replace both with blank
4. Repeat until the tape is empty or one symbol remains
5. Accept

**States:**

- $q_0$: Start. Read leftmost symbol.
- $q_a$: Saw `0`Going right to find rightmost
- $q_b$: Saw `1`Going right to find rightmost
- $q_{check0}$: At rightmost, check if it's `0`
- $q_{check1}$: At rightmost, check if it's `1`
- $q_{return}$: Going left to find leftmost
- $q_{accept}$: Accept
- $q_{reject}$: Reject

**Key transitions:**

- $q_0$ reads `0`: write blank, go right → $q_a$
- $q_0$ reads `1`: write blank, go right → $q_b$
- $q_0$ reads blank: accept (empty string is palindrome)
- $q_a$ reads `0` or `1`: move right
- $q_a$ reads blank: move left → $q_{check0}$
- $q_{check0}$ reads `0`: write blank, move left → $q_{return}$ (match!)
- $q_{check0}$ reads `1`: reject (mismatch!)
- $q_{return}$ reads `0``1`: move left
- $q_{return}$ reads blank: move right → $q_0$

This TM halts on all inputs (always reaches accept or reject), so the language of palindromes is
**decidable**. ✓

</details>

**Problem 6.** Prove that if the halting problem were decidable, then every semi-decidable language
Would be decidable.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Proof.** Let $L$ be a semi-decidable language. There exists a TM $M_L$ that accepts $w$ if
$w \in L$ and loops forever if $w \notin L$.

If the halting problem were decidable, we could build a TM $M$ that decides $L$:

1. On input $w$Run the halting decider $H$ on $(M_L, w)$
2. If $H$ says $M_L$ halts on $w$: $M_L$ will accept (since it only halts on members of $L$), so run
   $M_L$ on $w$ and accept
3. If $H$ says $M_L$ doesn't halt on $w$: reject (since $w \notin L$)

This TM $M$ always halts and correctly decides $L$. Since $L$ was arbitrary, every semi-decidable
Language would be decidable.

But we know the halting problem is undecidable, so there must exist semi-decidable languages that
Are not decidable (e.g., the halting problem itself). $\square$

</details>

**Problem 7.** Explain the difference between a decidable problem and a semi-decidable problem. Give
An example of each.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Decidable:** There exists a TM that halts on ALL inputs and correctly answers yes/no.

- Example: "Given a DFA $M$ and a string $w$Does $M$ accept $w$?" — simulate $M$ on $w$; it always
  halts.

**Semi-decidable (recursively enumerable):** There exists a TM that halts and accepts on
Yes-instances, but may loop forever on no-instances.

- Example: "Given a TM $M$ and input $w$Does $M$ halt on $w$?" — run $M$ on $w$; if it halts,
  accept. But if $M$ doesn't halt, our verifier loops forever.

**Key difference:** For semi-decidable problems, you can verify a "yes" answer in finite time, but
You cannot always verify a "no" answer (the machine might just be taking a long time, or it might
Loop forever).

</details>

**Problem 8.** Is the complement of the halting problem semi-decidable? Explain.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

No. The complement of the halting problem is **not** semi-decidable.

**Proof.** If both a language $L$ and its complement $\overline{L}$ were semi-decidable, then $L$
Would be decidable (run both semi-decidable machines in parallel; one must eventually halt, giving
The answer).

The halting problem is semi-decidable (run the TM and accept when it halts). If its complement were
Also semi-decidable, the halting problem would be decidable — but we proved it's not. Therefore, the
Complement of the halting problem is not semi-decidable. $\square$

</details>

**Problem 9.** Explain why the Travelling Salesman Problem (decision version: "Is there a tour of
Length ≤ k?") is in NP.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The TSP decision problem is in NP because a proposed solution (a tour) can be **verified** in
Polynomial time:

**Certificate:** A permutation of the $n$ cities (the proposed tour).

**Verification algorithm:**

1. Check that the certificate is a valid permutation of all $n$ cities — $O(n)$
2. Sum the distances between consecutive cities (and from last back to first) — $O(n)$
3. Compare the total to $k$ — $O(1)$

Total verification time: $O(n)$Which is polynomial. Therefore, TSP is in NP. ✓

(Note: this does NOT mean TSP is in P. Verification is polynomial, but finding the tour may not be.)

</details>

**Problem 10.** State the Church-Turing thesis. Explain why it is a thesis and not a theorem. What
Would it mean if it were false?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Church-Turing Thesis:** Every function that is effectively computable (can be computed by an
Algorithm) is computable by a Turing machine.

**Why it's a thesis, not a theorem:** "Effectively computable" is an informal, intuitive concept —
It refers to any step-by-step procedure that a human could follow with pen and paper (or a computer
Could execute). Since this is not a mathematically precise definition, we cannot formally prove that
Turing machines capture all of "computation." However, every reasonable model of computation
Proposed (lambda calculus, μ-recursive functions, register machines, modern programming languages)
Has been shown to be equivalent to Turing machines, providing overwhelming evidence for the thesis.

**If it were false:** There would exist an effectively computable function that no Turing machine
Could compute. This would mean our entire understanding of computation is fundamentally incomplete —
There would be a type of computation that our current theoretical models cannot capture. It would
Revolutionise computer science and mathematics, as it would imply the existence of a "super-Turing"
Model of computation.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Misunderstanding the difference between a stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO) in data structure
   applications.

2. Confusing an algorithm with a program. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, not its
   implementation in code.

3. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.

4. Mixing up Big O, Big $\Omega$, and Big $\Theta$ notation. Big O is an upper bound, not
   necessarily tight.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Assuming NFAs are more powerful than DFAs.** NFAs and DFAs accept exactly the same class of languages (the regular languages). NFAs are more convenient to write but not more powerful. The subset construction converts any NFA to an equivalent DFA.

2. **Misapplying the Pumping Lemma.** The Pumping Lemma shows a language is NOT regular by contradiction — you must show that for any pumping length p, there exists a string that cannot be pumped. Students often try to prove a language IS regular using the Pumping Lemma, which is impossible.

3. **Confusing semi-decidable with decidable.** The halting problem is semi-decidable — you can build a machine that accepts when it halts, but you cannot always reject when it doesn't halt (it would loop forever). Decidable problems always halt with the correct answer.

4. **Confusing P with NP.** P is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time. NP is the class whose YES-instances can be verified in polynomial time. P ⊆ NP, but whether P = NP is unknown. NP-complete problems are in NP but not known to be in P.

5. **Drawing NFA transitions incorrectly.** An NFA can have multiple transitions for the same input symbol from a single state, and can have ε-transitions (changing state without consuming input). DFAs have exactly one transition per symbol per state.

## Intuition

At its core, computability theory asks a deceptively simple question: what can a machine actually do? Imagine you have an infinitely powerful assistant who can follow instructions perfectly and never gets tired. The theory of computation draws a boundary around what that assistant could — and could not — accomplish, no matter how clever the instructions. Automata are the simplest models in this landscape: finite automata can only remember a limited amount of information (like a toggle switch), push-down automata add a stack for slightly more memory, and Turing machines get an unlimited tape. Each step up in power unlocks new categories of problems that become solvable.

The Church-Turing thesis ties this all together by claiming that the Turing machine — despite being a simple, mechanical device — captures everything we informally mean by "computable." Think of it like this: if you can describe a step-by-step procedure that a human could follow with pencil and paper, then a Turing machine can simulate it. This is remarkable because it means all programming languages, no matter how fancy their features, are ultimately equivalent in computational power. The differences between languages are about convenience and efficiency, not about what they can fundamentally compute.

Some problems, however, remain beyond reach. The halting problem — determining whether an arbitrary program will eventually stop or run forever — is famously undecidable. No algorithm can solve it for all possible inputs, and this sets a hard ceiling on what automated tools can guarantee. This insight has real consequences: it explains why perfect bug detectors, perfect optimisers, and perfect type-checkers are impossible. Recognising these limits is just as important as understanding what machines can do.
