**Recommended order of diagnostic completion:**

1. `diag-demand-supply` -- fundamental microeconomic toolkit
2. `diag-market-failure` -- builds on supply/demand and welfare analysis
3. `diag-theory-of-the-firm` -- requires understanding of costs and revenue
4. `diag-macroeconomic-policy` -- requires AD/AS model understanding

## Timing Recommendations

| Diagnostic                  | Recommended Time | Notes                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `diag-demand-supply`        | 40 minutes       | Quantitative questions require careful calculation |
| `diag-market-failure`       | 40 minutes       | Welfare analysis has many steps                    |
| `diag-theory-of-the-firm`   | 45 minutes       | Game theory and cost functions are complex         |
| `diag-macroeconomic-policy` | 45 minutes       | Multi-step policy analysis                         |

**Total recommended time:** approximately 2.8 hours (spread across multiple sessions).

**Full battery timing:** Complete all 4 diagnostics over 2 sessions of 80--90 minutes each.

## How to Use These Diagnostics

1. Complete each diagnostic without notes. Draw diagrams for every question.
2. Check solutions immediately, paying attention to both the method and the final answer.
3. If you score FAIL, review the corresponding source file before retrying.
4. If you score PARTIAL, focus on the specific calculation errors or conceptual gaps.
5. Integration Tests are critical for exam preparation -- A-Level economics exams frequently require
   applying microeconomic concepts to macroeconomic contexts (e.g., using supply/demand analysis in
   the context of international trade).
6. Always practice drawing labelled diagrams -- they are essential for full marks on exam questions.

## Section 3: Common Error Patterns

The following errors appear repeatedly in student work. Use this section to check your answers.

### Calculation Errors

| Error                                                                | Correct Approach                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confusing $\% \Delta Q / \% \Delta P$ with $\Delta Q / \Delta P$     | PED is a percentage ratio, not a slope. $PED = \frac◆LB◆\% \Delta Q◆RB◆◆LB◆\% \Delta P◆RB◆$.                              |
| Using average price/quantity incorrectly for midpoint PED            | Midpoint formula: $PED = \frac◆LB◆\Delta Q◆RB◆◆LB◆(Q_1+Q_2)/2◆RB◆ \div \frac◆LB◆\Delta P◆RB◆◆LB◆(P_1+P_2)/2◆RB◆$          |
| Forgetting that $MR = MC$ gives quantity, not price                  | Always find $Q$ from $MR = MC$Then find $P$ from the demand curve.                                                        |
| Using the nominal multiplier instead of the multiplier with leakages | With tax and imports: $k = \frac{1}{1 - MPC(1-t) + MPM}$.                                                                 |
| Adding tax revenue to calculate total surplus with externality       | Tax revenue is a TRANSFER, not a net welfare gain. It offsets the loss to consumers and producers.                        |
| Calculating deadweight loss as the full triangle without checking    | DWL $= \frac{1}{2} \times \text{tax} \times \Delta Q$. The $\Delta Q$ is the change in quantity, not the quantity itself. |

### Diagram Errors

| Error                                            | Correct Approach                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drawing SRAS as horizontal                       | SRAS slopes upward. Only the Keynesian SRAS (at very low output) is horizontal.             |
| Forgetting to label axes                         | Always label: vertical = price level ($P$), horizontal = real GDP ($Y$).                    |
| Shifting SRAS instead of moving along it         | A change in the price level causes a MOVEMENT along SRAS. A change in costs causes a SHIFT. |
| Drawing the LRAS through the current equilibrium | LRAS is at $Y^*$ regardless of where the current equilibrium is.                            |
| Showing a tax as a shift in demand               | A tax on producers shifts SUPPLY (upward). A tax on consumers shifts DEMAND (downward).     |

### Conceptual Errors

| Error                                        | Correct Approach                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Saying "demand falls" when price rises       | Price rises cause a "fall in quantity demanded" (movement along), not a "fall in demand" (shift). |
| Confusing absolute and comparative advantage | Absolute advantage: who produces more. Comparative advantage: who has lower opportunity cost.     |
| Treating the Phillips curve as stable        | The SR Phillips curve shifts when expectations change. The LR Phillips curve is vertical.         |
| Assuming supply-side policy works quickly    | Most supply-side policies have lags of 5-20 years. They cannot address short-run recessions.      |
| Confusing fiscal deficit with national debt  | Deficit: annual shortfall. Debt: accumulated stock of past deficits.                              |

## Section 5: Model Answers for Common Exam Questions

### Microeconomics: "Evaluate the impact of a tax on sugary drinks" (25 marks)

**Introduction:** Define the tax (specific tax per unit), identify the market structure, and state
that the evaluation depends on the PED of demand, the size of the externality, and the use of
revenue.

**Analysis:**

1. A specific tax shifts the supply curve leftward. The consumer price rises and the producer price
   falls. The burden is shared according to relative elasticities. For sugary drinks, PED is
   approximately -0.8 (inelastic) and PES is approximately 1.5 (elastic), so consumers bear the
   larger burden ($PES / (|PED| + PES) = 65\%$).
2. Quantity falls. The DWL is $\frac{1}{2} \times t \times \Delta Q$. This is a welfare loss from
   reduced consumption.
3. However, sugary drinks create negative externalities (health costs: obesity, diabetes, dental
   decay). The marginal external cost is estimated at GBP 0.20-0.50 per litre (Public Health
   England). A tax that equals the MEC corrects the externality, INCREASING welfare (the DWL from
   reduced consumption is offset by the gain from reduced external costs).
4. Tax revenue can be used to fund healthcare (hypothecation), further increasing welfare.

**Evaluation:**

- The tax is regressive (low-income households spend a larger share of income on sugary drinks).
  This worsens inequality.
- Substitution: consumers may switch to other unhealthy products (sweets, salty snacks) that are not
  taxed, reducing the health benefit.
- Cross-border shopping: if neighbouring countries do not have the tax, consumers may purchase
  drinks abroad.
- Industry impact: jobs may be lost in the soft drinks industry. But jobs may be created in
  healthier alternatives.
- Evidence: the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy (2018) led manufacturers to reformulate products
  (reduce sugar content by 30-50%). The tax worked primarily through reformulation rather than price
  increases.

**Conclusion:** the tax is justified on efficiency grounds (correcting a negative externality) but
requires complementary measures to address equity concerns (using revenue to fund health programmes
in deprived areas).

### Macroeconomics: "Evaluate the effectiveness of supply-side policies in achieving economic growth" (25 marks)

**Introduction:** Define supply-side policies (interventionist: education, infrastructure;
market-oriented: tax cuts, deregulation). Define economic growth (increase in real GDP or real GDP
per capita). State that effectiveness depends on the time horizon, the type of policy, and the
starting conditions.

**Analysis:**

1. Interventionist supply-side policies shift LRAS right by increasing productive capacity.
   Education raises human capital, infrastructure reduces business costs, R&D subsidies promote
   innovation. The Solow model predicts that higher savings and investment raise the steady-state
   capital stock, increasing output per worker permanently.
2. Market-oriented policies improve allocative efficiency. Tax cuts increase incentives to work,
   save, and invest. Deregulation reduces compliance costs and barriers to entry, increasing
   competition and innovation.
3. Empirical evidence: South Korea's education investment (1960s-1990s) contributed to sustained 7%
   annual growth. Thatcher's market-oriented reforms (privatisation, deregulation, trade union
   reform) increased productivity in the 1980s.

**Evaluation:**

- Time lags: education takes 10-20 years to affect productivity. Supply-side policy cannot address
  short-run recessions.
- Equity trade-off: tax cuts may increase inequality. Deregulation may reduce worker protections.
- Effectiveness depends on starting conditions: a country with low human capital gains more from
  education than one with already high human capital (diminishing returns).
- Government failure: industrial policy may "pick losers" (the UK's failed industrial policies in
  the 1970s). Market-oriented policies may create negative externalities (environmental
  deregulation).
- Demand-side complement: supply-side policy works best when demand is strong. In a recession, there
  is no point increasing productive capacity if there is no demand for the output.

**Conclusion:** supply-side policies are essential for LONG-RUN growth but must be complemented by
demand management for SHORT-RUN stabilisation. The optimal mix depends on the country's specific
circumstances.
