## 1. Monetarism vs Keynesianism

### 1.1 The Keynesian Revolution

Keynes (1936, _General Theory_) challenged the classical view that markets always clear. His central
Insight: **aggregate demand determines output in the short run**, and there is no automatic
Mechanism ensuring full employment.

**Key propositions:**

1. Prices and wages are **sticky downward**. They do not adjust quickly to clear markets
2. The economy can be in **equilibrium with involuntary unemployment** (a persistent output gap)
3. Active **fiscal policy** is needed to manage aggregate demand
4. The **multiplier** amplifies the effects of spending changes
5. **Liquidity preference** determines the interest rate: the demand for money is a stable function
   of income and the interest rate

$$IS-LM: \quad Y = C(Y - T) + I(r) + G, \quad \frac{M}{P} = L(Y, r)$$

### 1.2 The Monetarist Counter-Revolution

Friedman (1968, _The Role of Monetary Policy_) and the monetarists argued:

1. **"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"**: sustained inflation is caused by
   excessive growth of the money supply

$$\pi = \Delta M - \Delta V + \Delta Y \approx \Delta M - \Delta Y$$

(from the quantity theory: $MV = PY$)

2. **The long-run Phillips curve is vertical**: there is no long-run trade-off between inflation and
   unemployment

3. **Markets are broadly self-correcting**: given time, wages and prices adjust to restore full
   employment

4. **Fiscal policy is ineffective** (crowding out dominates), and **monetary policy is the primary
   tool** of macroeconomic stabilisation

5. **Discretionary policy is harmful**: due to lags and the time-inconsistency problem, systematic
   policy rules outperform discretionary interventions

### 1.3 The Policy Implications

| Issue                   | Keynesian View                           | Monetarist View                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cause of inflation      | Excess demand, cost-push                 | Excessive money supply growth                                |
| Cause of unemployment   | Insufficient aggregate demand            | Real wages above equilibrium (structural), plus natural rate |
| Role of fiscal policy   | Active and effective                     | Ineffective (crowding out), harmful (lags)                   |
| Role of monetary policy | Important, but fiscal policy also needed | Primary policy tool; should follow a rule                    |
| Phillips curve          | Short-run trade-off is exploitable       | Vertical in long run; only acceleration possible             |
| Self-correction         | Slow or non-existent                     | Automatic, though may take time                              |
| Government intervention | Essential for stability                  | Minimise — rules-based policy                                |

### 1.4 Evaluation: The Keynesian-Monetarist Debate in Practice

In practice, modern macroeconomic policy represents a **synthesis** of both views. The post-2008
Consensus acknowledges:

- **Short run**: Keynesian — active fiscal and monetary policy is essential when the economy is far
  from full employment, especially at the ZLB
- **Long run**: Monetarist — inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, and sustained fiscal
  deficits must be financed by money creation, risking inflation
- **Supply side**: Both schools now accept the importance of structural reforms for long-run growth

The key insight for exams: the "correct" view depends on the **time horizon** and the **state of the
Economy**. In a deep recession with spare capacity, Keynesian policies are more relevant. When the
Economy is near full employment, monetarist concerns about inflation dominate.

## 2. Rules vs Discretion

### 2.1 The Time-Inconsistency Problem

**Proposition (Kydland & Prescott, 1977): Discretionary policymakers have an incentive to renege on
Announced policies, leading to a suboptimal outcome (inflationary bias).**

_Proof sketch._ The central bank announces low inflation. If the public believes this, workers set
Moderate wage demands. The central bank then has an incentive to create surprise inflation to boost
Output (exploiting the short-run Phillips curve). But rational agents anticipate this — they don"t
Believe the announcement. The equilibrium has high inflation with no output gain. $\blacksquare$

Formally, the central bank's loss function:

$$L = (\pi - \pi^*)^2 + \beta(u - u^*)^2$$

Minimising subject to the Phillips curve $\pi = \pi^e - \alpha(u - u^*)$:

Under **discretion** (after expectations are formed): the optimal policy creates inflation bias:

$$\pi_{discretion} = \pi^* + \frac{\beta \alpha}{1 + \beta \alpha^2} > \pi^*$$

Under a **rule** (commitment to $\pi = \pi^*$): $\pi = \pi^*$ with no bias.

The rule dominates because it eliminates the inflationary bias without sacrificing output.

### 2.2 The Taylor Rule

The **Taylor Rule** (Taylor, 1993) is a specific monetary policy rule that prescribes how the
Central bank should set the interest rate in response to deviations of inflation from target and
Output from potential:

$$i = r^* + \pi + 0.5(\pi - \pi^*) + 0.5(y - y^*)$$

Where:

- $i$ = nominal interest rate (policy rate)
- $r^*$ = equilibrium real interest rate (estimated ~2%)
- $\pi$ = current inflation rate
- $\pi^*$ = target inflation rate
- $y - y^*$ = output gap (percentage deviation of actual from potential GDP)

**Interpretation**: The central bank raises the real interest rate by 0.5% for every 1% that
Inflation exceeds target, and by 0.5% for every 1% that output exceeds potential.

**Properties:**

- When $\pi = \pi^*$ and $y = y^*$: $i = r^* + \pi^*$ (neutral rate)
- When $\pi > \pi^*$: $i$ rises above neutral (tightening)
- When $y < y^*$: $i$ falls below neutral (loosening)

<details>
<summary>Worked Example</summary>
Suppose $r^* = 2\%$, $\pi^* = 2\%$Current $\pi = 5\%$Output gap = $-3\%$ (recession).

$$i = 2 + 5 + 0.5(5 - 2) + 0.5(-3) = 2 + 5 + 1.5 - 1.5 = 7\%$$

The Taylor Rule prescribes a 7% policy rate: above neutral (4%) to fight inflation, but moderated by
The recessionary output gap.

</details>

### 2.3 Arguments for Rules

1. **Anchors expectations**: a credible rule reduces uncertainty about future policy
2. **Eliminates time inconsistency**: removes the temptation for surprise inflation
3. **Transparent and accountable**: the public can evaluate whether the central bank is following
   the rule
4. **Prevents political pressure**: an independent central bank following a rule is insulated from
   electoral cycles

### 2.4 Arguments for Discretion

1. **Unforeseen circumstances**: rules cannot anticipate all shocks (financial crises, pandemics,
   wars)
2. **Model uncertainty**: the Taylor Rule assumes we know $r^*$, $y^*$And the correct coefficients. These are uncertain
3. **Multiple objectives**: rules may be too rigid when trade-offs between objectives change
4. **Communication**: discretion allows nuanced forward guidance

### 2.5 Time Lags and Policy Effectiveness

A critical challenge for both rules-based and discretionary policy is the existence of **time
Lags**:

1. **Recognition lag**: the time between a shock occurring and policymakers identifying it. Data is
   published with delays and is often revised.
2. **Decision lag**: the time between identifying a problem and implementing a policy response.
   Fiscal policy has a longer decision lag (parliamentary approval needed) than monetary policy (MPC
   meets monthly).
3. **Implementation lag**: the time between the decision and the policy taking effect. Monetary
   policy affects the economy through interest rate channels with a lag of 12–18 months. Fiscal
   policy (e.g., infrastructure spending) may take years to affect AD.
4. **Impact lag**: the time for the full effects to materialise in output and employment.

**Real-world example: The 2008 crisis.** The Bank of England cut rates from 5% to 0.5% between
October 2008 and March 2009, but the UK recession continued until Q3 2009. Fiscal stimulus (the 2008
Temporary VAT cut from 17.5% to 15%) was implemented relatively quickly but had limited effect — the
Multiplier was estimated at only 0.3–0.5 (IMF, 2010) because households saved the extra income
Rather than spending it (the **paradox of thrift**).

**Implication**: By the time discretionary policy takes effect, the economic conditions may have
Changed, potentially making the policy **pro-cyclical** (stimulating when the economy is already
Recovering, or tightening when it is entering recession). This is the strongest argument for
Rules-based policy — rules respond automatically, without lags.

### 2.6 Inflation Targeting: A Compromise

Most modern central banks use **inflation targeting with discretion**:

- **Explicit inflation target** (e.g., 2% CPI for the Bank of England)
- **Independence** to set interest rates to achieve the target
- **Accountability** through regular reports and parliamentary oversight
- **Flexibility** to respond to shocks (the target is symmetric — deviations above and below are
  equally undesirable)

$$\mathrm{UK (1992–present), NZ (1990–present), Canada (1991–present), Eurozone (2003–present)}$$

## 3. The Lucas Critique

### 3.1 Statement

**Proposition (Lucas, 1976): Policy evaluation using econometric models that assume fixed parameters
Is invalid, because the parameters of behavioural equations depend on the policy regime itself.**

### 3.2 Explanation

Traditional macroeconomic models estimated relationships (e.g., the Phillips curve, consumption
Function) from historical data, assuming the parameters were constant. Lucas argued that when policy
Changes, people's **expectations and behaviour change**, so the historical relationships no longer
Hold.

**Example: The Phillips Curve.** The historical Phillips curve (1958–1969) showed a stable inverse
Relationship between inflation and unemployment. Governments tried to exploit this trade-off by
Creating inflation to reduce unemployment. But once workers and firms anticipated higher inflation,
They adjusted wage demands and price-setting, and the trade-off disappeared. The Phillips curve
Shifted — the historical relationship was not a structural parameter but a function of the policy
Regime.

### 3.3 Implications

1. **Microfoundations**: macroeconomic models should be derived from individual optimisation
   (micro-founded), not estimated from aggregate data
2. **Policy evaluation**: you cannot reliably predict the effects of a new policy using models
   estimated under the old policy
3. **Rational expectations**: agents use all available information, including understanding of the
   policy regime, when forming expectations

$$\mathrm{Policy change} \Rightarrow \mathrm{Expectations change} \Rightarrow \mathrm{Behaviour changes} \Rightarrow \mathrm{Old model parameters invalid}$$

## 4. Post-2008 Policy Debates

### 4.1 The Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)

The **zero lower bound** is the constraint that nominal interest rates cannot fall significantly
Below zero (since holding cash pays zero nominal interest).

$$i \geq 0 \mathrm{ (approximately)}$$

When the equilibrium real interest rate is negative (as during a severe recession), the central bank
Cannot cut rates far enough to stimulate the economy. The economy is caught in a **liquidity trap**
(Keynes, 1936):

$$r^* < 0 \Rightarrow i = 0 \Rightarrow r = i - \pi^e = -\pi^e$$

Even with zero nominal rates, the real interest rate may be positive if expected inflation is
Negative (deflation). In this case, monetary policy is impotent — conventional tools have been
Exhausted.

### 4.2 Quantitative Easing (QE)

**Quantitative easing** is an unconventional monetary policy where the central bank purchases
Long-term assets (government bonds, corporate bonds) to increase the money supply and lower
Long-term interest rates when the policy rate is at the ZLB.

**Mechanism:**

$$\mathrm{Central bank buys bonds} \Rightarrow \mathrm{bond prices rise} \Rightarrow \mathrm{bond yields fall} \Rightarrow \mathrm{long-term interest rates fall}$$

$$\Rightarrow \mathrm{cheaper borrowing for firms and households} \Rightarrow \mathrm{investment and consumption increase}$$

$$\Rightarrow \mathrm{asset prices rise (portfolio rebalancing)} \Rightarrow \mathrm{wealth effect} \Rightarrow \mathrm{consumption increases}$$

$$\Rightarrow \mathrm{exchange rate may depreciate} \Rightarrow \mathrm{exports increase}$$

**UK QE programme**: The Bank of England purchased £875 billion of assets between 2009 and 2021,
Expanding the monetary base from ~£100bn to ~£800bn.

**The 2008 Financial Crisis: A Policy Case Study**

The global financial crisis provides the clearest real-world illustration of the
Keynesian-monetarist debate in action:

1. **Monetary response**: The Bank of England cut the base rate from 5.25% (October 2008) to 0.5%
   (March 2009) — the lowest in the `` `{BoE}` ``'s 315-year history. When this proved insufficient
   (ZLB), it launched QE in March 2009, purchasing GBP 75 billion of government bonds initially,
   eventually reaching GBP 875 billion by 2021.

2. **Fiscal response**: The Labour government introduced a GBP 20 billion fiscal stimulus package
   (November 2008), including a temporary VAT cut (17.5% to 15%), increased infrastructure spending,
   and support for the banking sector (GBP 500 billion in guarantees and capital injections). The
   budget deficit peaked at 10.2% of GDP in 2009–10.

3. **Austerity (2010–2015)**: The incoming Coalition government adopted a monetarist-inspired
   austerity programme, aiming to eliminate the structural deficit within five years. Public sector
   net borrowing was cut from 10.2% to 4.0% of GDP by 2014–15, but GDP growth averaged only 1.8%
   (vs. 2.5% pre-crisis trend), and real wages fell for the longest period since the 1860s.

4. **Evaluation**: The initial Keynesian response (2008–2009) was widely regarded as necessary to
   prevent a depression. However, the subsequent austerity programme is more controversial — many
   economists argue it delayed the recovery unnecessarily (the UK did not regain its pre-crisis GDP
   per capita level until 2015). The OBR (2013) estimated that austerity reduced GDP growth by
   approximately 1% per year between 2010 and 2013.

### 4.3 Evaluation of QE

**Advantages:**

- Provides stimulus when conventional policy is exhausted (ZLB)
- Lower long-term rates support investment and housing
- Prevents deflationary spiral
- Supports asset prices and financial stability

**Disadvantages:**

- **Distributional effects**: QE raises asset prices (bonds, equities, property), benefiting
  wealthier households who own these assets → increases inequality
- **Asset bubbles**: low rates may encourage excessive risk-taking and misallocation of capital
- **Exit strategy**: unwinding QE (selling bonds, raising rates) may destabilise financial markets
- **Diminishing returns**: each round of QE may have a smaller effect
- **Inflation risk**: if the money created is not absorbed when the economy recovers, inflation may
  surge

### 4.4 Fiscal Policy Revival

The 2008 crisis and the ZLB led to a **Keynesian revival**:

1. **Multipliers are larger at the ZLB**: with no crowding out (interest rates cannot rise), the
   fiscal multiplier is closer to its theoretical maximum. IMF (2012) revised its multiplier
   estimates upward to 0.9–1.7.

2. **Austerity was premature**: many economists (Blanchard, Stiglitz, Krugman) argued that fiscal
   consolidation in 2010–2012 slowed the recovery unnecessarily.

3. **The case for fiscal-monetary coordination**: when monetary policy is constrained, fiscal policy
   must take the lead. "Helicopter money" (Friedman, 1969) — direct monetary financing of government
   spending — entered mainstream debate.

4. **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**: argues that sovereign currency issuers cannot go bankrupt and
   should use fiscal policy freely until inflation emerges. This is highly controversial.

### 4.5 The Post-COVID Inflation Surge (2021–2023)

The pandemic and policy response created a new policy challenge:

- **Demand shock**: fiscal stimulus + pent-up consumer demand → AD surged
- **Supply shock**: supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, energy crisis (Ukraine war) → SRAS
  shifted left
- **Monetary accommodation**: interest rates at ZLB, QE continued

Result: inflation surged to 10.1% in the UK (July 2022) — the highest in 40 years.

**Policy response**: Bank of England raised rates from 0.1% to 5.25% (2021–2023). Government
Implemented tighter fiscal policy.

**Key debate**: Was the inflation **transitory** (as initially claimed by the Fed) or
**persistent**? In hindsight, a combination of persistent supply-side pressures and excess demand
Contributed, requiring a strong monetary tightening.

### 4.6 The COVID-19 Policy Response: Real-World Examples

The pandemic triggered an unprecedented policy response, illustrating both the power and limitations
Of macroeconomic policy:

**Fiscal packages by country:**

| Country | Fiscal Stimulus (as % of GDP) | Key Measures                                                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UK      | ~19% (2020–21)                | Furlough scheme (GBP 70 billion), business grants, VAT cut to 5% (hospitality) |
| US      | ~25% (2020–21)                | CARES Act (USD 2.2 trillion), stimulus checks, expanded unemployment benefits  |
| Germany | ~34% (2020–21)                | Kurzarbeit (short-time work), VAT cut, emergency aid for firms                 |
| Japan   | ~40% (2020–21)                | Cash handouts, business subsidies, tourism campaign                            |

**Evaluation**: The scale of fiscal response was justified by the Keynesian logic that when the
Private sector withdraws spending simultaneously (lockdowns), the government must fill the gap. The
Furlough scheme was particularly effective at preventing mass unemployment (UK unemployment peaked
At only 5.2%, compared to the OBR's initial forecast of 12%). However, the withdrawal of stimulus in
2021–22, combined with supply bottlenecks, contributed to the inflation surge.

### 4.7 Brexit Policy Trade-Offs

The UK's departure from the EU created unique macroeconomic policy challenges:

1. **Trade friction**: Non-tariff barriers (customs checks, regulatory divergence) reduced UK-EU
   trade by an estimated 15% (OBR, 2022). This is a negative supply shock (LRAS shifts left),
   reducing potential output.

2. **Labour market effects**: The end of free movement reduced EU worker inflows, contributing to
   labour shortages in agriculture, hospitality, and logistics — a cost-push inflation factor
   post-Brexit and post-COVID.

3. **Policy implications**: The supply-side nature of the Brexit shock meant that demand management
   tools (fiscal and monetary policy) could not fully offset the output loss. Supply-side policies
   (training, investment, deregulation) were needed, but these take years to deliver results.

4. **Exchange rate**: GBP depreciated by ~15% against USD following the 2016 referendum, providing a
   temporary export boost (Marshall-Lerner conditions satisfied) but increasing import prices and
   contributing to inflation.

**Exam evaluation point**: Brexit illustrates the limits of demand-side policy in addressing
Supply-side shocks. No amount of fiscal or monetary stimulus can fully compensate for the loss of
Trade openness and labour mobility — only structural supply-side reforms can address the root
Causes.

## 5. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)

### 5.1 Core Propositions

Modern Monetary Theory, associated with economists such as Warren Mosler, Stephanie Kelton, and Bill
Mitchell, argues:

1. **Sovereign currency issuers cannot go bankrupt**: a government that issues its own fiat currency
   can always meet obligations denominated in that currency by creating money. The constraint is not
   solvency but inflation.

$$\mathrm{Government can always pay} \iff \mathrm{debt denominated in own currency}$$

2. **Functional finance** (Lerner, 1943): fiscal policy should be used to achieve full employment
   and price stability, regardless of the deficit. The deficit is not a target — real outcomes are.

3. **Taxes drive money**: taxes create demand for the government's currency (people need it to pay
   taxes). Taxes are not primarily a revenue-raising tool but a tool to control inflation and
   redistribute income.

4. **Sectoral balances**: the government deficit equals the non-government sector surplus:

$$(G - T) = (S - I) + (M - X)$$

If the government runs a balanced budget, the private sector cannot net-save (unless there is a
Current account surplus). A government deficit is necessary for private sector net saving.

### 5.2 Evaluation

**Strengths**: (1) Correctly identifies that sovereign currency issuers face an inflation
Constraint, not a solvency constraint. (2) Highlights the importance of functional outcomes over
Arbitrary deficit targets. (3) Sectoral balances identity is accounting-accurate.

**Weaknesses**: (1) Underestimates inflation risks — the 2021–2023 inflation surge showed that
Excessive fiscal stimulus combined with supply constraints does generate inflation. (2) Assumes the
Government can perfectly calibrate fiscal policy to maintain full employment without inflation —
This requires information the government does not have. (3) Ignores political economy — giving
Governments a "blank cheque" risks fiscal profligacy and loss of market confidence. (4) May not
Apply to countries that borrow in foreign currency (emerging markets — most developing countries).
(5) Assumes away the crowding out channel and Ricardian equivalence too casually.

Prescriptions risky.
</aside>
### 5.3 Exam Technique: Evaluating Policy Frameworks

When evaluating any macroeconomic policy framework (inflation targeting, MMT, fiscal rules), use the
Following structure:

1. **Define** the policy framework and its objectives
2. **Explain the mechanism**. How does it work in theory?
3. **Apply** with real-world evidence. Use specific data points (e.g., "UK inflation averaged 2.0%
   under inflation targeting, 1992–2020")
4. **Evaluate** by considering:

- **Effectiveness**: did it achieve its stated objectives?
- **Trade-offs**: what was sacrificed? (e.g., QE increased inequality)
- **Context dependency**: does it work in all circumstances? (e.g., inflation targeting fails at the
  ZLB)
- **Unintended consequences**: what went wrong? (e.g., austerity slowed recovery)
- **Alternatives**: what would have worked better?

5. **Conclude** with a balanced judgement. "On balance, X was effective in achieving Y but failed
   to address Z."

## 6. Policy Mixes for Various Scenarios

### 5.1 Scenario Analysis

| Scenario                      | Problem                                    | Recommended Policy Mix                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recession + low inflation** | Output gap, deflation risk                 | Expansionary fiscal + expansionary monetary (rates cut, QE)                |
| **Overheating + inflation**   | Output above potential, demand-pull        | Contractionary fiscal + contractionary monetary (rates raised)             |
| **Stagflation**               | High inflation + low growth (supply shock) | Supply-side policy + tight monetary + targeted fiscal (support vulnerable) |
| **BoP deficit + growth**      | Current account worsening                  | Depreciation + supply-side (improve competitiveness) + fiscal tightening   |
| **ZLB recession**             | Deep recession, rates at zero              | Aggressive fiscal expansion + QE + forward guidance                        |
| **Currency crisis**           | Capital flight, sharp depreciation         | Raise rates (defend currency) + IMF support + structural reform            |

### 5.2 The Assignment Problem

The **assignment problem** (Mundell, 1962): which policy instrument should be assigned to which
Objective?

**Mundell's principle of effective market classification**: assign each instrument to the objective
On which it has the most comparative advantage.

- **Monetary policy** → price stability (domestic objective)
- **Fiscal policy** → output stabilisation (domestic objective)
- **Exchange rate policy** → BoP equilibrium (external objective)

Under floating exchange rates, the BoP is self-correcting (exchange rate adjusts), so monetary and
Fiscal policy can focus on domestic objectives.

### 6.3 Policy Coordination and Conflict

In practice, fiscal and monetary policy may **conflict** rather than coordinate:

**Example 1: The UK (2010–2015)**. The government pursued fiscal austerity (contractionary fiscal
Policy) while the Bank of England maintained expansionary monetary policy (QE + low rates). This
Policy mix created unusual dynamics: government borrowing costs fell to record lows (QE pushed down
Gilt yields), but bank lending to the real economy remained weak — the "rebalancing" the government
Sought (towards manufacturing and exports) was undermined by the strong pound caused by capital
Inflows attracted by QE.

**Example 2: The US (2017–2019)**. The Trump administration pursued expansionary fiscal policy (Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act, 2017 — USD 1.5 trillion over 10 years) while the Fed was tightening monetary
Policy (raising rates from 0.5% to 2.5%). This created upward pressure on interest rates and the
Dollar, partially crowding out the fiscal stimulus.

**Key principle**: When fiscal and monetary policy pull in the same direction, their effects are
Amplified. When they pull in opposite directions, they partially offset each other, and the net
Effect depends on the relative strength of each.

## 7. Nominal GDP Targeting: An Alternative Framework

### 7.1 Concept

Instead of targeting inflation, the central bank could target the **growth rate of nominal GDP**:

$$\mathrm{Target: } \Delta(NGDP) = \Delta(Real\ GDP) + \pi = \mathrm{constant (e.g., 5\%)}$$

### 7.2 Advantages over Inflation Targeting

1. **Automatic stabiliser**: A negative supply shock (SRAS shifts left) raises inflation but reduces
   real growth. Under inflation targeting, the central bank raises rates (worsening the recession).
   Under NGDP targeting, the central bank accommodates — the nominal target is unchanged, so the
   central bank loosens to support real growth.

2. **Handles demand and supply shocks symmetrically**: The central bank responds to the _nominal_
   income gap, not just the inflation gap.

3. **Better communication**: "We will ensure total spending in the economy grows at 5% per year" is
   arguably clearer than "We will ensure prices rise at 2% per year."

4. **Financial stability**: Accommodates supply shocks without tightening, reducing the risk of
   over-tightening after cost-push inflation.

### 7.3 Disadvantages

1. **Measurement**: Real-time GDP data is revised frequently and with long lags. The central bank
   might be targeting the wrong number.

2. **Double-counting risk**: If a supply shock reduces real GDP, NGDP targeting requires the central
   bank to accommodate with more inflation — the public may see this as "accepting inflation."

3. **Less established**: No major central bank has adopted NGDP targeting (though some economists
   advocate it strongly — Sumner, 2011; Frankel, 2012).

4. **Political feasibility**: shifting from an established framework (inflation targeting) to an
   untested one faces resistance.

## 8. Problem Set

**Problem 1.** Using the quantity theory of money ($MV = PY$), explain the monetarist argument that
"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." Under what conditions might this
Statement be less valid?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
From $MV = PY$: if $V$ is stable (Friedman's assumption) and $Y$ is at potential in the long run (LRAS vertical), then $\Delta P \approx \Delta M$. Sustained inflation requires sustained money supply growth. Conditions where this is less valid: (1) $V$ is not stable — during financial crises, velocity falls sharply (people hoard cash), so $\Delta M$ does not translate to $\Delta P$. (2) The economy has a large output gap — $Y$ can increase, absorbing the money supply growth. (3) Supply shocks cause inflation without money supply growth (cost-push). (4) In the short run, prices are sticky, so $\Delta M$ affects $Y$ not $P$ (Keynesian view). Overall: the monetarist argument is strong in the long run but weaker in the short run and during crises.

**Problem 2.** Suppose the central bank follows the Taylor Rule with $r^* = 2\%$, $\pi^* = 2\%$And
Coefficients 0.5 for both inflation and output gap. Calculate the prescribed interest rate when: (a)
$\pi = 3\%$$y - y^* = 0\%$(b) $\pi = 2\%$$y - y^* = -4\%$(c) $\pi = 6\%$$y - y^* = 1\%$. Comment on
the results.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
(a) $i = 2 + 3 + 0.5(1) + 0.5(0) = 5.5\%$. Rate above neutral (4%) to fight inflation. (b) $i = 2 + 2 + 0.5(0) + 0.5(-4) = 2\%$. Rate below neutral — aggressive easing for the recession. (c) $i = 2 + 6 + 0.5(4) + 0.5(1) = 2 + 6 + 2 + 0.5 = 10.5\%$. Very aggressive tightening — high inflation combined with above-potential output. The Taylor Rule responds symmetrically to inflation and output deviations, providing a systematic and transparent framework.
</details>

**Problem 3.** Explain the Lucas critique. Why does it imply that traditional macroeconomic models
Are unreliable for policy evaluation? Illustrate your answer with the Phillips curve example.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
The Lucas critique: when policy changes, people's expectations and behaviour change, so relationships estimated under the old policy regime are no longer valid. Phillips curve example: the 1958–1969 Phillips curve showed a stable trade-off. Governments tried to exploit it by creating inflation to reduce unemployment. But once agents (workers, firms) learned that inflation was being deliberately created, they built inflation expectations into wage and price setting. The Phillips curve shifted upward — for any given unemployment rate, inflation was now higher. The historical relationship was not a structural law but a function of the low-inflation policy regime. Once the regime changed (higher inflation policy), the relationship broke down. Implication: to evaluate policy, we need models based on deep structural parameters (preferences, technology) that do not change when policy changes — i.e., micro-founded models. *Revision: see [Macroeconomic Performance](/economics/macro/macroeconomic-performance) for the Phillips curve derivation.*
</details>

**Problem 4.** "Quantitative easing was a necessary and effective response to the 2008 financial
Crisis, but it has created significant long-term problems." Evaluate this statement.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Necessary: (1) Interest rates were at the ZLB — conventional monetary policy was exhausted. (2) QE prevented a deeper recession and deflation. (3) It stabilised financial markets by providing liquidity. (4) Evidence suggests it lowered long-term rates by 1–2 percentage points. Effective: (1) UK GDP returned to pre-crisis levels by 2013. (2) Inflation remained close to target (until 2021). (3) Financial markets stabilised. Long-term problems: (1) Wealth inequality — QE inflated asset prices, benefiting the wealthy (BoE estimated top 5% gained 40% of benefits). (2) Asset bubbles — property prices surged, creating affordability issues. (3) Zombie firms — low rates kept unproductive firms alive. (4) Exit strategy — unwinding QE without disrupting markets is challenging. (5) Distorted incentives — prolonged low rates may have delayed necessary structural reforms. *Revision: see [The Financial Sector](/economics/macro/the-financial-sector) for QE mechanisms.*
</details>

**Problem 5.** The economy is experiencing stagflation: inflation is 8% and rising, while GDP growth
Has fallen to -1%. The central bank's inflation target is 2%. Using the AD/AS framework, explain the
Policy dilemma and evaluate possible policy responses.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
The dilemma: the economy faces both high inflation (requiring contractionary policy) and low growth (requiring expansionary policy). The AD/AS analysis: SRAS has shifted left (cost-push — e.g., oil prices, supply chain disruption). This raises $P$ and reduces $Y$ simultaneously. Option 1: Do nothing → wait for self-correction (wages fall, SRAS shifts right). But this takes time and causes prolonged unemployment. Option 2: Contractionary monetary policy (raise rates) → AD shifts left → inflation falls but recession deepens. Option 3: Expansionary fiscal policy → AD shifts right → output rises but inflation worsens. Option 4: Supply-side policy → shift SRAS right → both $P$ falls and $Y$ rises (the ideal solution, but takes time). Option 5: Accept higher inflation temporarily → use nominal GDP targeting instead of inflation targeting. Best approach: a combination of tight monetary policy (to anchor expectations), targeted fiscal support (to protect the vulnerable), and aggressive supply-side reform (to address the root cause). *Revision: see [Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply](/economics/macro/aggregate-demand-and-supply).*
</details>

**Problem 6.** "Inflation targeting has been a success and should continue to be the primary
Objective of monetary policy." Evaluate this statement with reference to the experience of the UK
Since 1992.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Successes: (1) UK inflation averaged 2.0% from 1992–2020, compared to 10%+ in the 1970s. (2) Inflation expectations became well-anchored. (3) The Bank of England's independence (1997) enhanced credibility. (4) Transparent framework improved accountability. Limitations: (1) Pre-2008, inflation targeting contributed to neglect of financial stability (the BoE focused on CPI while a housing bubble built up). (2) Post-2021, inflation targeting failed to prevent the inflation surge (10.1% in 2022) — the target was breached by a wide margin for an extended period. (3) Inflation targeting may have been too tight post-2008, preventing faster recovery (the BoE could have been more aggressive). (4) A single target ignores output and employment objectives. Reform proposals: (1) Nominal GDP targeting (more flexible, accommodates supply shocks). (2) Average inflation targeting (Fed's new approach, 2020). (3) Dual mandate (like the Fed: price stability + maximum employment). (4) Financial stability as a co-equal objective.
</details>

**Problem 7.** Explain the time-inconsistency problem. How does an independent central bank with an
Inflation target help to solve it?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Time inconsistency (Kydland & Prescott, 1977): the optimal policy ex ante (when expectations are being formed) differs from the optimal policy ex post (after expectations are set). The central bank promises low inflation. Once workers set moderate wage demands based on this promise, the bank is tempted to create surprise inflation to boost output (moving along the SRPC). Rational agents anticipate this, so they don't believe the promise. Result: high inflation with no output gain (inflationary bias). Solution: an independent central bank with an explicit inflation target solves this by: (1) Removing the political incentive to boost output before elections. (2) Creating a reputation for low inflation — if the bank deviates, it loses credibility. (3) Providing a clear benchmark for accountability. (4) Delegating to a "conservative" central banker (Rogoff, 1985) who places greater weight on inflation than the government. The UK's institutional framework (Bank of England independence + 2% inflation target + MPC) is designed to address the time-inconsistency problem.
</details>

**Problem 8.** "The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the Keynesian view of macroeconomic policy
Is more relevant than the monetarist view." Discuss.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Arguments for: (1) The pandemic caused a massive demand shock (lockdowns → AD collapsed). Keynesian fiscal stimulus (furlough, business grants) was essential to prevent a depression. (2) Monetary policy hit the ZLB — conventional tools were exhausted, confirming the Keynesian concern about the liquidity trap. (3) QE (an unconventional monetary tool) was essentially Keynesian in spirit — government-issued liquidity to support demand. (4) The multiplier was large (estimated 1.0–1.5), validating Keynesian predictions. (5) Austerity during recovery (monetarist approach) was widely rejected as harmful. Arguments against: (1) The post-pandemic inflation surge showed that excessive money creation (monetarist concern) does cause inflation — money supply grew 20%+ in 2020. (2) The Bank of England's eventual tightening (rates from 0.1% to 5.25%) was monetarist in spirit — controlling the money supply/inflation. (3) Supply-side constraints (labour shortages, supply chains) were the primary driver of inflation, not just demand. Best answer: the pandemic validated aspects of both views — Keynesianism for the recession response (active fiscal policy essential at the ZLB), monetarism for the inflation response (tighten monetary policy when inflation rises). The modern consensus is a pragmatic synthesis.

**Problem 9.** "Brexit has made it harder for the UK government to achieve its macroeconomic
Objectives." Evaluate this statement with reference to the period 2016–2025.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Macroeconomic objectives: economic growth, price stability, low unemployment, balance of payments
Equilibrium. Brexit effects: (1) **Growth**: the OBR estimated Brexit would reduce long-run
Productivity by 4% — this shifts LRAS left, reducing trend growth. UK GDP growth averaged 1.4%
(2017–2019) vs. 2.1% (2013–2016). (2) **Inflation**: the 15% sterling depreciation (2016) increased
Import prices, contributing to inflation peaking at 3.1% in 2017. The `` `{BoE}` `` responded by
Raising rates, creating a trade-off with growth. (3) **Employment**: unemployment fell to 3.5%
(2022) — a 50-year low — partly because reduced EU migration tightened the labour market. However,
Labour shortages in key sectors (NHS, agriculture, hospitality) represent a supply constraint. (4)
**Balance of payments**: the trade deficit with the EU widened as non-tariff barriers reduced
Exports. The current account deficit averaged 3.5% of GDP (2017–2023). However, (5) **policy
Flexibility**: leaving the EU gave the UK freedom to pursue independent monetary policy, set its own
Regulations, and sign trade deals (e.g., CPTPP, 2024). Evaluation: on balance, the evidence suggests
Brexit has made macroeconomic management harder, primarily through supply-side constraints and
Reduced trade openness. However, some effects are confounded with COVID-19, making attribution
Difficult.

**Problem 10.** To what extent is the Lucas critique relevant for modern macroeconomic
Policy-making? Discuss with reference to the UK's experience of quantitative easing.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
The Lucas critique argues that relationships estimated under one policy regime may not hold when
Policy changes. Application to QE: (1) **Interest rate channel**: pre-2008 models estimated a stable
Relationship between the policy rate and long-term borrowing costs. QE changed this relationship by
Directly purchasing long-term assets — the historical interest rate transmission mechanism was
Altered. (2) **Portfolio rebalancing**: the standard IS-LM framework assumes money and bonds are
Substitutes. QE works partly through a portfolio rebalancing channel (investors sell bonds to the
Central bank and buy riskier assets), which is not captured in traditional models. (3)
**Expectations**: QE's effectiveness depends partly on signalling (forward guidance) — the central
Bank's announcement effect. If the public's expectations formation process changes in response to QE
(e.g., learning that the central bank will buy bonds in a crisis), then the historical relationship
Between policy and expectations is unreliable. (4) **Counterargument**: some relationships have
Proved relatively stable. The Phillips curve, despite shifting, still shows a short-run trade-off.
The Taylor Rule, while not followed mechanically, still provides a useful benchmark for the
`` `{BoE}` ``'s rate decisions. Overall: the Lucas critique remains highly relevant — it reminds us
That the unprecedented scale of QE means historical evidence may be an unreliable guide to its
Effects, particularly regarding inflation and the exit strategy.
</details>

**Problem 11.** Assess the case for replacing inflation targeting with nominal GDP targeting as the
Primary monetary policy framework for the Bank of England.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Case for NGDP targeting: (1) **Automatic stabiliser**: NGDP targeting would have led to a more
Accommodative response after the 2008 crisis and during COVID — the `` `{BoE}` `` would not have
Tightened prematurely as inflation rose due to supply shocks. (2) **Handles supply shocks better**:
The 2021–2023 inflation was partly cost-push (energy, supply chains). Under NGDP targeting, the
`` `{BoE}` `` would have accommodated more inflation (since real GDP was falling), reducing the
Depth of the recession. (3) **Simplicity**: a single target for the growth of total nominal income
Is arguably easier to communicate than an inflation target. (4) **Financial stability**: by not
Overtightening after supply shocks, NGDP targeting may reduce the risk of triggering a financial
Crisis. Case against: (1) **Measurement problems**: GDP data is revised frequently and with long
Lags (3–6 months). The `` `{BoE}` `` might be targeting an incorrect number. Inflation data, by
Contrast, is available monthly with less revision. (2) **No precedent**: no major central bank has
Adopted NGDP targeting, so there is no real-world evidence of its effectiveness. (3) **Legitimacy**:
NGDP targeting could be seen as "giving up on price stability" — the public may resist a framework
That explicitly tolerates higher inflation. (4) **Confusion**: the public understands "2% inflation"
But may not understand "5% nominal GDP growth." (5) **Distributional effects**: accommodative policy
After supply shocks may benefit borrowers at the expense of savers. Conclusion: NGDP targeting is
Intellectually appealing but faces significant practical obstacles. The best reform may be a more
Flexible inflation target (average inflation targeting, as adopted by the Fed in 2020) rather than a
Complete regime change.

## Common Mistakes

Keynesian demand management is appropriate during recessions (especially at the zero lower bound), while monetarist concerns about inflation dominate near full employment. The "correct" view depends on the economic context.

5. **Assuming QE always works.** Quantitative easing's effectiveness depends on the state of the banking system, the slope of the yield curve, and whether the economy is at the zero lower bound. In a liquidity trap, QE may have limited effect if banks hoard reserves rather than lending.

## 8. Advanced Policy Debates: Worked Examples

### 8.1 Taylor Rule: Full Numerical Application

**Example.** Suppose an economy has the following parameters:

- Inflation target: $\pi^* = 2\%$
- Current inflation: $\pi = 6\%$
- Potential output growth: $g^* = 2.5\%$
- Current output growth: $g = 1.0\%$
- Equilibrium real interest rate: $r^* = 2\%$

**Taylor Rule (standard version):** $$i = r^* + \pi^* + 0.5(\pi - \pi^*) + 0.5(g - g^*)$$

$$i = 2 + 2 + 0.5(6 - 2) + 0.5(1.0 - 2.5) = 4 + 2 - 0.75 = 5.25\%$$

**Interpretation:** The Taylor Rule recommends an interest rate of 5.25%. The inflation gap (4
percentage points above target) pushes rates up by 2 percentage points. The output gap (1.5
percentage points below trend) pushes rates down by 0.75 percentage points. The dominant concern is
inflation.

**What if the central bank uses different weights?**

| Weight on inflation gap | Weight on output gap |         Recommended rate         |
| :---------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------------------: |
|           0.5           |         0.5          |     5.25% (standard Taylor)      |
|           1.0           |         0.5          | 7.25% (aggressive on inflation)  |
|           0.5           |         1.0          |   4.50% (aggressive on output)   |
|           1.5           |         0.5          |      9.25% (Volcker-style)       |
|           0.5           |         0.0          | 6.00% (inflation-only targeting) |

**Taylor principle:** For the Taylor Rule to stabilise the economy, the coefficient on the inflation
gap must be greater than 1. If the coefficient is 1 or less, a rise in inflation does not raise the
REAL interest rate enough to reduce demand. The standard Taylor Rule (coefficient = 0.5 on the gap,
but 1.0 on the level since $i$ includes $\pi^*$) satisfies this principle.

**Application to the UK (2022-2023):** The Bank Rate was raised from 0.25% to 5.25% between December
2021 and August 2023. Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022.

Taylor Rule recommendation at peak inflation ($\pi = 11.1\%$$g = 0.2\%$):
$$i = 2 + 2 + 0.5(11.1 - 2) + 0.5(0.2 - 2.5) = 4 + 4.55 - 1.15 = 7.4\%$$

The actual Bank Rate (5.25%) was BELOW the Taylor Rule recommendation, suggesting monetary policy
was still accommodative relative to the inflation outlook. This gap partly reflected the cost-push
nature of the inflation (energy prices, supply chain disruption), which the BoE judged would be
temporary.

### 8.2 Rules vs Discretion: Formal Analysis

**The time-inconsistency problem (Kydland and Prescott, 1977).**

**Setup.** The government announces low inflation ($\pi^a = 2\%$). Workers set wages based on this
expectation. After wages are set, the government has an incentive to create surprise inflation to
boost output.

**Model.** Loss function: $L = (\pi - \pi^*)^2 + \beta(u - u^*)^2$ where $\beta$ measures the weight
on unemployment.

Phillips curve: $u = u^* - \alpha(\pi - \pi^e)$.

**If the government is credible (rules):** $\pi^e = \pi^a = 2\%$. Government sets $\pi = 2\%$.
$u = u^*$. Loss $= 0 + 0 = 0$. First-best outcome.

**If the government reneges (discretion):** After wages are set at $\pi^e = 2\%$The government
minimises:
$$L = (\pi - 2)^2 + \beta(u^* - \alpha(\pi - 2) - u^*)^2 = (\pi - 2)^2 + \beta\alpha^2(\pi - 2)^2 = (\pi - 2)^2(1 + \beta\alpha^2)$$

Minimising: $\pi^* = 2$ (optimal to stick to the promise). Loss is still zero.

But suppose there is a negative output shock: $u = u^* + \epsilon - \alpha(\pi - \pi^e)$ where
$\epsilon > 0$.

**Under discretion:** Government minimises $L$ taking $\pi^e$ as given. The optimal $\pi$ is higher
than $\pi^e$ because the government tries to exploit the short-run Phillips curve to offset the
shock.

**Rational expectations:** Workers anticipate the government's incentive to inflate. In equilibrium:
$$\pi^e = \pi^* + \frac{\beta\alpha}{1 + \beta\alpha^2}(u^* - u^*) = \pi^*$$

Wait -- let me redo this properly. Under rational expectations with discretion:

$$\pi = \pi^* + \frac{\beta\alpha}{1 + \beta\alpha^2}\epsilon$$

$$\pi^e = \pi^* + \frac{\beta\alpha}{1 + \beta\alpha^2}\epsilon$$

Workers correctly anticipate the inflationary bias. The unemployment rate is:
$$u = u^* + \epsilon - \alpha\left(\frac{\beta\alpha}{1 + \beta\alpha^2}\epsilon\right) = u^* + \frac{\epsilon}{1 + \beta\alpha^2}$$

The output gain from surprise inflation is zero (since workers anticipate it), but inflation is
higher. This is the **inflationary bias** of discretionary policy.

**Numerical example:** $\beta = 1$$\alpha = 0.5$$\pi^* = 2\%$$\epsilon = 2\%$.

Under rules (credible commitment): $\pi = 2\%$$u = u^* + 2\%$. Loss $= 0 + 4 = 4$.

Under discretion:
$\pi = 2 + \frac{1 \times 0.5}{1 + 1 \times 0.25} \times 2 = 2 + 0.8 = 2.8\%$.
$u = u^* + \frac{2}{1.25} = u^* + 1.6\%$.

Loss $= (2.8 - 2)^2 + 1 \times (1.6)^2 = 0.64 + 2.56 = 3.2$.

Discretion produces a LOWER loss than rules because the government can partially offset the shock.
However, the inflation rate is higher (2.8% vs 2%).

**Key insight:** The benefit of discretion is flexibility in responding to shocks. The cost is an
inflationary bias. An independent central bank with a clear mandate provides the best of both
worlds: commitment to low inflation (solving the bias) with some flexibility to respond to shocks
(through the output gap term in the Taylor Rule).

### 8.3 Keynesian vs Monetarist: A Full AD/AS Comparison

**Example.** An economy experiences a negative demand shock (fall in consumer confidence).

**Keynesian analysis:**

- AD shifts left. SR equilibrium moves down along the SRAS curve.
- Output falls below potential. Unemployment rises.
- Prices and wages are STICKY downward (contracts, menu costs, efficiency wages). The economy
  remains below full employment indefinitely.
- **Policy response:** Expansionary fiscal policy (increase $G$ or cut $T$) or monetary policy (cut
  $r$) to shift AD back.
- The multiplier amplifies the initial stimulus: $\Delta Y = k \cdot \Delta G$ where
  $k = \frac{1}{1 - MPC}$.
- With $MPC = 0.8$: $k = 5$. A GBP 10bn increase in $G$ raises $Y$ by GBP 50bn.

**Monetarist analysis:**

- AD shifts left. SR equilibrium moves down along the SRAS curve.
- Output falls below potential. Unemployment rises.
- Prices and wages are FLEXIBLE. Unemployed workers accept lower wages. SRAS shifts right.
- The economy self-corrects: SRAS shifts right until output returns to $Y^*$ at a lower price level.
- **Policy response:** Do nothing. Any discretionary policy will be implemented with a lag and may
  overshoot, creating instability.
- Friedman's k-percent rule: grow the money supply at a constant rate equal to the long-run growth
  rate of real GDP.

**Numerical comparison.** Economy at $Y^* = 500$. AD shock reduces output to 400.

**Keynesian policy:** Government increases $G$ by 20 with $k = 5$. $\Delta Y = 5 \times 20 = 100$.
New $Y = 500$. Economy returns to full employment. Cost: budget deficit increases by 20 (before
multiplier effects on tax revenue). Risk: if the multiplier is overestimated ($k = 3$),
$\Delta Y = 60$New $Y = 460$. Policy is insufficient.

**Monetarist approach:** Wait for self-correction.

- Year 1: $Y = 400$$u = 8\%$ (natural rate 5%). Wages fall 2%.
- Year 2: SRAS shifts right. $Y = 440$$P$ falls. $u = 6.4\%$.
- Year 3: $Y = 470$$u = 5.6\%$.
- Year 4: $Y = 490$$u = 5.1\%$.
- Year 5: $Y = 500$$u = 5\%$. Full employment restored.

The economy self-corrects in approximately 5 years, during which cumulative lost output is
approximately $100 + 60 + 30 + 10 = 200$ units of GDP.

**Keynesian counter-argument:** This is an enormous waste of resources. Active policy can restore
full employment in 1-2 years, saving 150+ units of GDP. The risk of policy error is smaller than the
cost of doing nothing.

**Monetarist counter-counter-argument:** If policy is mistimed (implemented after the economy has
already begun recovering), it may OVERSTIMULATE, creating an inflationary boom-bust cycle. The 1970s
stagflation is evidence of policy-induced instability.

### 8.4 Forward Guidance: Credibility and Expectations

**Example.** The Bank of England announces that it will keep interest rates at 0.5% until
unemployment falls below 7% (similar to the Fed's forward guidance in 2012-2013).

**Mechanism:**

- By committing to low rates for an extended period, the BoE lowers EXPECTED future short-term
  rates.
- The yield curve flattens: long-term rates fall because they reflect expected future short-term
  rates plus a term premium.
- Lower long-term rates stimulate investment and consumption of durable goods.
- The policy works through the EXPECTATIONS CHANNEL rather than the conventional interest rate
  channel.

**Quantitative impact.** Suppose the yield curve is: $$r_{10y} = E[r_{1y}] + \text{term premium}$$

Without forward guidance: $E[r_{1y}] = 2.5\%$ in 3 years. Term premium = 1%. $r_{10y} = 3.5\%$.

With forward guidance (rates at 0.5% for 3 more years): $E[r_{1y}] = 1.5\%$ in 3 years.
$r_{10y} = 2.5\%$.

The 100 basis point reduction in 10-year rates reduces mortgage rates, corporate bond yields, and
the cost of capital.

**Effectiveness depends on credibility:**

- If markets believe the guidance: long rates fall, stimulating the economy. The policy is powerful.
- If markets doubt the guidance (e.g., they expect the BoE to raise rates early due to inflation
  concerns): long rates do not fall much. The policy is weak.
- The "Evans Rule" (Fed, 2012): linked rate guidance to specific unemployment and inflation
  thresholds, making the commitment more credible by removing discretion.

**Limitations of forward guidance:**

- If the economy improves faster than expected, the central bank may need to break its promise,
  damaging credibility.
- Forward guidance is most effective at the zero lower bound, when conventional policy is exhausted.
- It may create perverse incentives: if the public knows rates will stay low until unemployment
  falls, there is less incentive for households to spend (they expect the recovery to be slow).

### 8.5 NGDP Level Targeting: Detailed Worked Example

**Example.** The economy is hit by a 5% negative demand shock. Compare the response under (a)
inflation targeting, (b) NGDP level targeting, and (c) NGDP growth rate targeting.

**Baseline:** NGDP = 100, real GDP = 100, price level = 1.0. Target inflation = 2%, target NGDP
growth = 2%.

**After the shock:** Real GDP falls 5% to 95. Price level falls 2% to 0.98. NGDP =
$95 \times 0.98 = 93.1$.

**Recovery path under each regime:**

| Year      |      Inflation Target      |     NGDP Growth Target     |      NGDP Level Target       |
| --------- | :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| 0 (shock) |  NGDP=93.1, Y=95, P=0.98   |  NGDP=93.1, Y=95, P=0.98   |   NGDP=93.1, Y=95, P=0.98    |
| 1         | NGDP=95.0, Y=97.9, P=0.97  | NGDP=95.0, Y=97.9, P=0.97  | NGDP=102.0, Y=100.9, P=1.011 |
| 2         | NGDP=96.9, Y=100, P=0.969  | NGDP=96.9, Y=100, P=0.969  |  NGDP=104.0, Y=100, P=1.040  |
| 3         | NGDP=98.8, Y=100, P=0.988  | NGDP=98.8, Y=100, P=0.988  |  NGDP=106.1, Y=100, P=1.061  |
| 5         | NGDP=102.9, Y=100, P=1.029 | NGDP=102.9, Y=100, P=1.029 |  NGDP=110.4, Y=100, P=1.104  |

**Under inflation targeting:** The central bank targets 2% inflation. After the shock, it raises
rates only gradually. NGDP recovers slowly. By year 3, NGDP is still 1.2% below the pre-shock trend.
The economy suffers a PERMANENT loss of NGDP (level effect).

**Under NGDP growth rate targeting:** Same as inflation targeting in practice (since the growth rate
target is 2%, the central bank responds similarly).

**Under NGDP LEVEL targeting:** The central bank commits to making up the lost NGDP. It runs more
expansionary policy (lower rates for longer) to push NGDP back to the original trend line. By year
1, NGDP has already returned to the trend. The price level is slightly higher (1.011 vs 1.0
baseline), but the economy has recovered fully.

**Key advantage of level targeting:** it prevents the permanent level effect of demand shocks. The
central bank "makes up for past mistakes" by running more expansionary policy after a negative shock
and more contractionary policy after a positive shock.

## 9. Exam-Style Questions with Full Mark Schemes

**Question 1 (25 marks).** "Independent central banks are more effective at controlling inflation
than governments." Evaluate this statement using the time-inconsistency framework and real-world
evidence.

<details>
<summary>Full Mark Scheme</summary>
**Arguments for independence (10 marks):**
- Time-inconsistency problem (Kydland and Prescott, 1977): elected governments face a temptation to create surprise inflation before elections to boost output. Rational agents anticipate this, leading to an inflationary bias without any output gain. Independent central banks, with long fixed terms, are insulated from this temptation.
- Empirical evidence: countries with more independent central banks have lower average inflation (Alesina and Summers, 1993). Germany (Bundesbank) and Switzerland had the most independent central banks and the lowest inflation in the 1970s-1980s.
- Credibility: an independent central bank with a clear mandate is more credible than a government, reducing inflation expectations and making disinflation less costly (the sacrifice ratio is lower).
- The Bank of England's independence (1997) is associated with a period of stable inflation (2% +/- 1% target band) until the 2021-2023 cost-push shock.

**Arguments against independence (10 marks):**

- Democratic deficit: monetary policy has major distributional effects (savers vs borrowers,
  homeowners vs renters). An unelected body making these decisions lacks democratic legitimacy.
- Inflexibility: independent central banks may be too focused on inflation and ignore output and
  employment. The BoE's focus on inflation targeting in 2022-2023 was criticised for raising rates
  despite weak growth.
- Coordination problems: monetary and fiscal policy must be coordinated for optimal outcomes.
  Independence may lead to conflict between the central bank and the government.
- Financial stability: the BoE's dual mandate (inflation and financial stability) creates potential
  conflicts. Tightening to control inflation may trigger a financial crisis.
- The post-2008 and post-COVID experience shows that independent central banks made significant
  errors (failing to predict inflation, being too slow to tighten).

**Evaluation (5 marks):**

- Independence is a second-best solution to the time-inconsistency problem. It works well in normal
  times but may be suboptimal during crises when flexibility is needed.
- The optimal degree of independence depends on the political context. In countries with a history
  of fiscal dominance (government pressures the central bank to monetise debt), independence is
  crucial. In countries with strong fiscal institutions, some coordination may be beneficial.
- The BoE's post-1997 record is generally positive but not unblemished. The 2021-2023 inflation
  episode revealed limitations.
- Conclusion: independence improves inflation performance but must be balanced with accountability
and flexibility.

**Question 2 (12 marks).** Use the Taylor Rule to assess whether the Bank of England's monetary
policy was appropriate during 2021-2023.

<details>
<summary>Full Mark Scheme</summary>
**Taylor Rule calculation (4 marks):**
Using $i = 2 + 2 + 0.5(\pi - 2) + 0.5(g - 2.5)$:

- December 2021: $\pi = 5.4\%$$g = 0.9\%$. Taylor rate
  $= 4 + 0.5(3.4) + 0.5(-1.6) = 4 + 1.7 - 0.8 = 4.9\%$. Actual Bank Rate: 0.25%. Policy was far
  below the Taylor Rule.
- June 2022: $\pi = 9.4\%$$g = 0.2\%$. Taylor rate
  $= 4 + 0.5(7.4) + 0.5(-2.3) = 4 + 3.7 - 1.15 = 6.55\%$. Actual Bank Rate: 1.25%. Still well below.
- August 2023: $\pi = 6.8\%$$g = 0.2\%$. Taylor rate
  $= 4 + 0.5(4.8) + 0.5(-2.3) = 4 + 2.4 - 1.15 = 5.25\%$. Actual Bank Rate: 5.25%. Now consistent.

**Assessment (4 marks):** The BoE was "behind the curve" in 2021-2022, keeping rates too low
relative to the Taylor Rule recommendation. This contributed to inflation becoming embedded. By
August 2023, policy had caught up.

**Qualifications (4 marks):**

- The Taylor Rule is a guide, not a law. The cost-push nature of the inflation (energy prices,
  supply chains) may have justified a more gradual response.
- The UK economy was weak (near-zero growth), so aggressive tightening risked a deep recession.
- The BoE argued that much of the inflation was "transitory" (they were wrong about timing but not
  about the direction).
- The lags in monetary policy (12-18 months) mean that the full effect of the 2022-2023 tightening
was not yet visible when rates peaked.

### 10.1 The Phillips Curve: A Full Historical Analysis

**Example.** UK inflation and unemployment data (selected years):

| Year | Unemployment | Inflation | Inflation expectations |
| :--: | :----------: | :-------: | :--------------------: |
| 1960 |     1.5%     |   1.0%    |          1.5%          |
| 1970 |     2.5%     |   6.4%    |          4.0%          |
| 1975 |     4.0%     |   24.2%   |         15.0%          |
| 1980 |     6.0%     |   18.0%   |         14.0%          |
| 1985 |    11.0%     |   5.0%    |          6.0%          |

| 2010 |     7.9%     |   3.3%    |          3.0%          |
| 2015 |     5.3%     |   0.1%    |          1.5%          |
| 2020 |     4.5%     |   0.9%    |          1.8%          |
| 2022 |     3.7%     |   9.1%    |          5.0%          |
| 2023 |     4.0%     |   7.3%    |          6.0%          |

**Analysis using the Phillips curve framework:**

**1960s (stable trade-off):** Low unemployment (1.5%) coincided with low inflation (1.0%). The
apparent trade-off suggested policymakers could choose any combination of unemployment and
inflation. The Phillips curve seemed stable.

**1970s (breakdown of the trade-off):** Unemployment rose from 2.5% to 4.0% while inflation ROSE
from 6.4% to 24.2%. This was impossible under the original Phillips curve (which predicted an
inverse relationship). The breakdown was caused by:

- Oil price shocks (1973, 1979): cost-push inflation shifted the SRPC up.
- Adaptive expectations: as inflation rose, workers demanded higher wages, creating a wage-price
  spiral.
- Loose monetary policy: the Bank of England accommodated the oil shocks by expanding the money
  supply, validating higher inflation expectations.

**1980s (Volcker-style disinflation):** Thatcher's government and the Bank of England raised
interest rates sharply to reduce inflation. Unemployment rose to 11% (the highest since the Great
Depression) but inflation fell to 5%. The sacrifice ratio was approximately 2-3: for each 1
percentage point reduction in inflation, unemployment was 2-3 percentage points higher for several
years.

**1990s-2000s (Great Moderation):** Both inflation and unemployment were low and stable. The
inflation target (introduced 1992) anchored expectations. The Phillips curve appeared flat: changes
in unemployment had little effect on inflation. This led some economists to argue that the Phillips
curve was "dead."

**2022-2023 (post-pandemic inflation):** Inflation surged to 9.1% despite unemployment being
relatively low (3.7%). The Phillips curve relationship was not visible because the inflation was
driven by supply shocks (energy, supply chains) rather than excess demand. This episode highlighted
the limitations of demand management in the face of supply-side inflation.

**Key lessons:**

1. The Phillips curve is NOT a stable menu of policy options.
2. Expectations matter: anchored expectations flatten the Phillips curve; unanchored expectations
   steepen it.
3. Supply shocks can cause simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment (stagflation).
4. The long-run Phillips curve is vertical at the natural rate.
5. The Phillips curve is most useful as a framework for understanding inflation dynamics, not as a
   precise forecasting tool.

### 10.2 Monetarism vs Keynesianism: The 2008 Crisis as a Case Study

**Example.** Analyse the 2008 financial crisis and the policy response using both Keynesian and
monetarist frameworks.

**The crisis:**

- Triggered by the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market.
- UK bank lending froze. Northern Rock was nationalised (2008). RBS and Lloyds required government
  bailouts.
- UK GDP fell 6% in 2008-2009. Unemployment rose from 5% to 8%.
- Inflation fell from 5% to 1% (risk of deflation).

**Keynesian analysis:**

- A massive negative demand shock (collapse of investment and consumption due to financial panic).
- The multiplier amplified the shock: falling incomes reduced spending, further reducing incomes.
- Animal spirits (Keynes): consumer and business confidence collapsed, creating a self-fulfilling
  prophecy of recession.
- Policy response: expansionary fiscal policy (bank bailouts, temporary VAT cut from 17.5% to 15%,
  increased public spending). Estimated fiscal stimulus: GBP 75 billion (approximately 5% of GDP).
- The Keynesian prescription was followed: government spending filled the gap left by the private
  sector. The recession was severe but shorter than it would have been without intervention.

**Monetarist analysis:**

- The crisis was caused by monetary factors: excessively loose monetary policy in the early 2000s
  (Fed funds rate at 1%) created a housing bubble.
- The bubble burst when rates rose, revealing the misallocation of capital.
- The correct response: allow the recession to purge the malinvestment (liquidationist view).
  Bailing out banks creates moral hazard -- they will take excessive risks in future, expecting to
  be rescued.
- Friedman's k-percent rule: the BoE should have maintained steady money growth rather than engaging
  in discretionary QE.
- Monetarist critique of QE: creating GBP 895 billion of new money risked future inflation (this did
  not materialise, undermining the monetarist prediction).

**Synthesis:**

- The Keynesian approach was appropriate for the short-run crisis management: fiscal stimulus
  prevented a deeper recession.
- The monetarist concern about moral hazard was valid: bank bailouts without structural reform
  (splitting retail and investment banking, increasing capital requirements) may sow the seeds of
  future crises.
- Both frameworks contributed: fiscal policy addressed the demand shortfall, while monetary policy
  (QE) addressed the liquidity crisis. Supply-side reform (Basel III, Vickers Commission) addressed
  the structural issues.
- The post-crisis period (2009-2019) was characterised by slow growth and low inflation -- the
  "secular stagnation" hypothesis (Summers, 2013) combined Keynesian concerns about deficient demand
  with monetarist concerns about the limits of monetary policy.

### 10.3 Fiscal Rules: Design and Evaluation

**Example.** The UK has used various fiscal rules over the past 25 years. Analyse their
effectiveness.

**Fiscal rules used:**

| Period       | Rule                                      | Target                                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1997-2007    | Golden Rule + Sustainable Investment Rule | Borrow only to invest; debt < 40% of GDP                    |
| 2010-2015    | Fiscal Mandate + Supplementary Target     | Structural deficit eliminated by 2015; debt falling by 2015 |
| 2015-2019    | Fiscal Mandate + Supplementary Target     | Surplus by 2020; debt falling by 2020                       |
| 2021-present | Fiscal Mandate + Supplementary Target     | Debt falling by 5th year; welfare cap                       |

**Evaluation of specific rules:**

**Golden Rule (1997-2007):**

- The rule distinguished between current spending (to be funded by tax revenue) and investment (to
  be funded by borrowing).
- This was economically sensible: investment generates future returns that can service the debt.
- However, the definition of "investment" was flexible. Current spending was sometimes reclassified
  as investment to meet the rule.
- The rule was met in every year of the Labour government (1997-2008), but this was partly due to
  strong economic growth (which boosted tax revenues) rather than fiscal discipline.
- When the 2008 crisis hit, the rule was immediately abandoned, demonstrating its limitations as a
  constraint during downturns.

**Structural deficit target (2010-2015):**

- Targeted the structural (cyclically-adjusted) deficit rather than the actual deficit.
- This was an improvement: it allowed automatic stabilisers to operate (the actual deficit could
  rise in a recession without breaching the rule).
- Problem: the structural deficit is an estimate, not an observable variable. Different estimates
  (OBR vs Treasury vs IMF) gave different numbers, creating uncertainty about whether the rule was
  being met.
- The target was missed: the structural deficit was not eliminated by 2015 because the recovery was
  slower than expected.

**Debt-falling rule (2021-present):**

- Requires that debt as a share of GDP must be falling by the fifth year of the forecast.
- This is a forward-looking rule based on the OBR's economic forecasts.
- Problem: the rule can be met by assuming optimistic growth forecasts (which may not materialise).
- The rule provides limited constraint in the short term: the government can borrow heavily for the
  first 4 years as long as the OBR projects debt to be falling by year 5.
- The Truss mini-budget (2022) demonstrated the risk of fiscal rules without market discipline: the
  government's unfunded tax cuts were inconsistent with the debt-falling rule, triggering a gilt
  market crisis and a sharp fall in sterling.

**Lessons from fiscal rules:**

1. Simple, transparent rules are better than complex, flexible ones (easy to understand, hard to
   manipulate).
2. Rules should focus on the structural deficit and debt ratio (allowing automatic stabilisers to
   operate).
3. Independent forecasters (like the OBR) are essential for credibility.
4. Rules must be complemented by market discipline: if investors lose confidence in the government's
   fiscal plan, borrowing costs rise regardless of the rule.
5. No fiscal rule can substitute for political will and economic judgement. The best rule is one
   that is credibly enforced by an independent fiscal institution.

### 10.4 The Impossible Trinity (Mundell-Fleming): Worked Example

**Example.** A country wants to maintain all three of: (1) free capital mobility, (2) a fixed
exchange rate, and (3) independent monetary policy. Show why this is impossible.

**Setup:**

- Fixed exchange rate: $E = E_0$ (domestic currency pegged to USD).
- Capital mobility: investors can freely move funds in and out.
- Monetary policy: the central bank sets the domestic interest rate.

**Scenario 1: The central bank tries to lower interest rates (expansionary monetary policy).**

- Domestic interest rate falls below the world rate.
- Investors sell domestic assets and move capital abroad (seeking higher returns).
- Capital outflow creates downward pressure on the exchange rate.
- To maintain the peg, the central bank must buy domestic currency (selling foreign reserves).
- Buying domestic currency REDUCES the money supply, offsetting the initial expansion.
- The monetary expansion is fully neutralised. Monetary policy is ineffective.

**Numerical example:**

- World interest rate: 5%. Domestic rate: 3%.
- Capital outflow: GBP 100 billion (investors move funds abroad).
- Central bank intervention: sells USD 100 billion, buys GBP 100 billion.
- Money supply falls by GBP 100 billion, pushing interest rates back up towards 5%.
- The peg is maintained, but monetary policy independence is lost.

**Scenario 2: The central bank tries to raise interest rates (contractionary monetary policy).**

- Domestic interest rate rises above the world rate.
- Capital inflow: investors buy domestic assets.
- Upward pressure on the exchange rate.
- Central bank sells domestic currency (buying foreign reserves).
- Money supply increases, offsetting the contraction.
- Monetary policy is again neutralised.

**The trilemma in practice:**

| Country            |  Exchange rate  | Capital mobility | Monetary independence |   Policy choice    |
| ------------------ | :-------------: | :--------------: | :-------------------: | :----------------: |
| USA                |    Floating     |       Free       |          Yes          | Choose (1) and (3) |
| China (pre-2005)   |      Fixed      |    Restricted    |          Yes          | Choose (1) and (3) |
| Eurozone countries |  Fixed (euro)   |       Free       |  No (ECB sets rates)  | Choose (1) and (2) |
| Hong Kong          | Fixed (USD peg) |       Free       |          No           | Choose (1) and (2) |

**Application to Brexit:** Before Brexit, the UK had free capital mobility, a floating exchange
rate, and independent monetary policy (the "Anglo-Saxon" model). Some Brexit supporters advocated a
fixed exchange rate or joining the ERM. The impossible trinity shows that the UK could not have a
fixed exchange rate AND independent monetary policy with free capital flows. The UK's choice of
floating rate + monetary independence was the correct one for a large, open economy subject to
asymmetric shocks.

## 11. Extended Worked Examples

### 11.1 Average Inflation Targeting: Quantitative Comparison

**Example.** Compare three monetary policy frameworks: (a) strict inflation targeting (2% +/- 0),
(b) flexible inflation targeting (2% +/- 1), and (c) average inflation targeting (2% average over 5
years).

**Scenario: a supply shock pushes inflation to 5% in year 1, then returns to 2% in year 2.**

**Strict inflation targeting (2% +/- 0):** Year 1: inflation = 5%. Target = 2%. Deviation = 3
percentage points. The central bank raises rates aggressively to bring inflation back to 2% as
quickly as possible. Policy rate rises by approximately 2-3 percentage points. Output falls by
approximately 2% (sacrifice ratio of 0.5-1.0).

Year 2: inflation = 2%. Target = 2%. The central bank cuts rates. But the output loss from year 1 is
permanent (hysteresis).

**Flexible inflation targeting (2% +/- 1):** Year 1: inflation = 5%. Outside the tolerance band (+/-
1). The central bank must act. But the response is more gradual than strict targeting because the
band allows some flexibility. Policy rate rises by 1-2 percentage points. Output falls by
approximately 1%.

**Average inflation targeting (Fed model, 2% average over 5 years):** Year 1: inflation = 5%. The
average over the previous 4 years was 2%. The running average is $(2 \times 4 + 5) / 5 = 2.6\%$.
This is above the 2% target, but the central bank looks at the TREND, not the level. Policy
response: mild tightening (0.5-1 percentage point). Output falls by approximately 0.5%.

Years 2-5: inflation returns to 2%. The running average gradually falls back to 2%. The central bank
does not need to "overshoot" with deflation to bring the average back down.

**Welfare comparison:**

| Framework     | Rate increase | Output loss | Inflation volatility |
| ------------- | :-----------: | :---------: | :------------------: |
| Strict (0%)   |    2-3 pp     |    2.0%     |         High         |
| Flexible (1%) |    1-2 pp     |    1.0%     |        Medium        |
| Average       |   0.5-1 pp    |    0.5%     |         Low          |

**Evaluation:**

- Average inflation targeting is the most welfare-improving for supply shocks because it minimises
  the output cost of disinflation.
- However, average targeting may reduce central bank credibility if the public perceives it as
  "allowing higher inflation."
- Flexible inflation targeting (the BoE's current framework: 2% +/- 1) strikes a reasonable balance
  between credibility and flexibility.
- The optimal framework depends on the nature of shocks: strict targeting is better for demand
  shocks, average targeting is better for supply shocks.

### 11.2 Fiscal Dominance vs Central Bank Independence

**Example.** In a fiscal dominance regime, the central bank is subordinate to the government and
must finance government deficits by purchasing bonds. Analyse the consequences.

**Fiscal dominance model:** Government deficit = 10% of GDP. The central bank is required to buy all
government bonds that the market does not absorb. If the market absorbs 60% of new issuance, the
central bank buys 40%.

Money supply growth: 40% of 10% of GDP = 4% of GDP in new money per year. If velocity is constant
and potential output growth is 2%: inflation = money growth - output growth = 4% - 2% = 2%.

If the deficit rises to 15%: central bank purchases 6% of GDP. Inflation rises to 4%.

**Time inconsistency:** The government has an incentive to inflate away the real value of its debt.
If the government has debt of 100% of GDP and creates 10% inflation, the real debt burden falls by
approximately 10% (assuming nominal debt is fixed).

**Welfare cost:**

- Inflation erodes real wages and savings.
- Unpredictable inflation creates uncertainty, reducing investment.
- The central bank cannot pursue an independent monetary policy (it must accommodate the fiscal
  deficit regardless of the inflation outlook).
- This creates a vicious cycle: fiscal deficits cause inflation, which raises nominal interest
  rates, which increases the cost of servicing the debt, which widens the deficit further.

**Historical examples:**

- Zimbabwe (2000s): fiscal dominance led to hyperinflation (89.7 sextillion % in 2008).
- Argentina (repeatedly): fiscal deficits financed by central bank credit creation led to recurring
  crises.
- UK (pre-1997): the government set interest rates, and the BoE was not independent. This
  contributed to the inflationary bias of the 1970s.

**The solution: central bank independence + fiscal rules.**

- The Bank of England Act (1998) gave the BoE operational independence (the power to set interest
  rates).
- The Fiscal Responsibility Act (2010) established fiscal rules (debt and deficit targets).
- The Office for Budget Responsibility (2010) provides independent economic forecasts.
- This framework has delivered low and stable inflation (2% +/- 1% for most of the period
  1997-2021).

**Evaluation:** central bank independence is not a panacea. If the government ignores fiscal rules
and runs large deficits, the central bank faces a dilemma: tighten monetary policy (causing a
recession) or accommodate the deficit (losing credibility). The Truss mini-budget (2022)
demonstrated this tension: the government's unfunded tax cuts were inconsistent with the BoE's
inflation target, triggering a gilt market crisis and forcing a policy reversal.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using circular reasoning by assuming the conclusion when evaluating economic policy
   effectiveness.

2. Failing to evaluate both strengths and weaknesses of economic models, not just listing them.

3. Stating that 'demand falls' without specifying whether it is a contraction (movement along) or a
   decrease (shift) of the demand curve.

4. Neglecting to consider the ceteris paribus assumption when analysing multi-variable economic
   scenarios.

The Keynesian-monetarist debate boils down to a simple question: when the economy goes wrong, should the government step in or step back? Keynesians say the government should be an active firefighter — when a recession hits, people stop spending, firms stop investing, and the whole economy spirals downward unless someone fills the gap. That someone is the government. By spending more or cutting taxes, it puts money in people's pockets, which they spend, which creates jobs, which creates more spending — the famous multiplier. Monetarists worry that the firefighter sometimes starts the fire. They argue that governments, tempted by short-term political gains, pump too much money into the economy, causing inflation. Their solution is simpler: set a steady rule for money growth and let the economy find its own balance. The honest answer is that both are right — Keynesian medicine works best in deep recessions when everyone is paralysed, while monetarist caution matters most when the economy is running hot.

The time-inconsistency problem is one of the most elegant ideas in economics, and it explains why politicians can't be trusted with the money supply. Imagine a government promises low inflation. Believing this, workers accept moderate pay rises. But then the government thinks: "If I secretly create a bit of inflation, firms will hire more workers and the economy will boom — and by the time workers realise, the election will be over." The problem is that workers aren't stupid. They figure out this trick, demand higher wages upfront, and you end up with high inflation and no extra jobs. It's like a restaurant that promises fresh food but keeps reheating yesterday's soup — eventually customers stop believing the menu. The solution is to hand the keys to an independent central bank that can't be tempted by election cycles.

Quantitative easing and the zero lower bound reveal the limits of conventional economics. When interest rates hit zero, the central bank's main tool is broken — you can't cut rates below zero (or at least, not far). QE is the emergency response: the central bank creates new money and uses it to buy government bonds, pushing down long-term interest rates and encouraging banks to lend. Think of it as the central bank flooding the plumbing of the financial system with oil to get the gears turning again. But QE has a dirty secret — it mainly benefits people who own assets (houses, shares, bonds), which tend to be wealthier. It's like watering a garden by flooding the top of the hill: the rich plants get plenty, but the poor ones at the bottom may not see a drop. This is why the post-2008 recovery felt so uneven, and why debates about QE's fairness are just as important as debates about its effectiveness.
