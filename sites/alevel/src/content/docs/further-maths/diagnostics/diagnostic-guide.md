**Total recommended time:** approximately 6 hours (spread across 3--4 sessions).

## How to Use These Diagnostics

1. Complete each diagnostic without notes, showing full algebraic working.
2. Check solutions immediately, comparing both method and final answer.
3. If you score FAIL, review the corresponding source file before retrying.
4. Integration Tests combine skills across pure maths topics -- these mirror A-Level exam style.
5. Practise writing proofs with clear logical steps.
6. Pay special attention to convergence conditions for series and Maclaurin expansions.
