## Chi-Squared Tests

The chi-squared test is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether observed data
Deviates significantly from expected values. It has two main applications: testing goodness of fit
(to a theoretical distribution) and testing for independence (between two categorical variables).

## 1. The Chi-Squared Distribution

### 1.1 Definition

**Definition.** If $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_k$ are independent standard normal random variables, then

$$\chi^2_k = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + \cdots + Z_k^2$$

Follows a **chi-squared distribution** with $k$ degrees of freedom, written $\chi^2_k$.

### 1.2 Properties

- The distribution is defined only for $\chi^2 \geq 0$
- It is positively skewed, becoming more symmetric as $k$ increases
- $E(\chi^2_k) = k$
- $\mathrm{Var}(\chi^2_k) = 2k$
- As $k \to \infty$The distribution approaches a normal distribution $N(k, 2k)$
- The distribution is additive: if $X \sim \chi^2_a$ and $Y \sim \chi^2_b$ are independent, then
  $X + Y \sim \chi^2_{a+b}$

### 1.3 Critical values

Critical values are found from chi-squared tables. For a test at significance level $\alpha$ with
$\nu$ degrees of freedom, the critical value $\chi^2_{\alpha,\nu}$ satisfies:

$$P(\chi^2_\nu > \chi^2_{\alpha,\nu}) = \alpha$$

<hr />

## 2. Goodness of Fit Test

### 2.1 Hypotheses

- $H_0$: The data follows the specified distribution
- $H_1$: The data does not follow the specified distribution

### 2.2 Test statistic

$$\boxed{\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}}$$

Where $O_i$ is the observed frequency and $E_i$ is the expected frequency for category $i$.

### 2.3 Degrees of freedom

$$\nu = n - 1 - c$$

Where $n$ is the number of categories and $c$ is the number of parameters estimated from the data.

- If no parameters are estimated: $\nu = n - 1$
- If the mean of a Poisson is estimated from the data: $\nu = n - 2$
- If both mean and standard deviation of a normal are estimated: $\nu = n - 3$

### 2.4 Conditions

For the chi-squared approximation to be valid:

1. **Expected frequencies** should be $\geq 5$ for each category
2. If any expected frequency is $< 5$**merge adjacent categories** before carrying out the test
3. The observations must be **independent**

### 2.5 Yates" correction (continuity correction)

For a $2 \times 2$ contingency table with small expected frequencies, Yates' correction adjusts the
Test statistic:

$$\chi^2_{\mathrm{Yates}} = \sum\frac{(|O_i - E_i| - 0.5)^2}{E_i}$$

This correction makes the test more conservative (less likely to reject $H_0$).

> **Caution:** warning categories if expected frequencies are too small.
### 2.6 Worked example: Poisson goodness of fit

**Example.** Over 100 days, the number of accidents per day at a factory was recorded:

| Accidents ($r$) | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | $\geq 5$ |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- |
| Days ($O_r$)    | 38  | 32  | 18  | 8   | 3   | 1        |

Test at the 5% level whether the data follows a Poisson distribution.

**Step 1:** Estimate $\lambda$ from the data:

$$\bar{r} = \frac{0(38)+1(32)+2(18)+3(8)+4(3)+5(1)}{100} = \frac{109}{100} = 1.09$$

**Step 2:** Calculate expected frequencies using $\mathrm{Po}(1.09)$:

$P(X=0) = e^{-1.09} \approx 0.3365 \implies E_0 = 33.65$

$P(X=1) = 1.09\,e^{-1.09} \approx 0.3668 \implies E_1 = 36.68$

$P(X=2) = \dfrac{1.09^2}{2}e^{-1.09} \approx 0.1999 \implies E_2 = 19.99$

$P(X=3) = \dfrac{1.09^3}{6}e^{-1.09} \approx 0.0726 \implies E_3 = 7.26$

$P(X=4) = \dfrac{1.09^4}{24}e^{-1.09} \approx 0.0198 \implies E_4 = 1.98$

$P(X \geq 5) = 1 - 0.9956 \approx 0.0044 \implies E_5 = 0.44$

**Step 3:** Merge categories so all $E_i \geq 5$. Merge $r \geq 3$:

| $r$   | 0     | 1     | 2     | $\geq 3$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| $O_r$ | 38    | 32    | 18    | 12       |
| $E_r$ | 34.99 | 36.74 | 19.29 | 8.98     |

**Step 4:** Calculate the test statistic:

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(38-34.99)^2}{34.99} + \frac{(32-36.74)^2}{36.74} + \frac{(18-19.29)^2}{19.29} + \frac{(12-8.98)^2}{8.98}$$

$$= \frac{9.06}{34.99} + \frac{22.47}{36.74} + \frac{1.66}{19.29} + \frac{9.12}{8.98} \approx 0.259 + 0.612 + 0.086 + 1.016 = 1.973$$

**Step 5:** Degrees of freedom: $\nu = 4 - 1 - 1 = 3$ (4 categories, 1 parameter estimated).

**Step 6:** Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,3} = 7.815$.

Since $1.973 < 7.815$**do not reject** $H_0$.

There is insufficient evidence to suggest the data does not follow a Poisson distribution.

<hr />

## 3. Test for Independence

### 3.1 Contingency tables

**Definition.** A **contingency table** (or two-way table) displays the frequency distribution of
Two categorical variables.

### 3.2 Hypotheses

- $H_0$: The two variables are independent
- $H_1$: The two variables are not independent

### 3.3 Expected frequencies

For a contingency table with entries $O_{ij}$ (row $i$Column $j$), the expected frequency is:

$$\boxed{E_{ij} = \frac{(\mathrm{row } i \mathrm{ total}) \times (\mathrm{column } j \mathrm{ total})}{\mathrm{grand total}}}$$

### 3.4 Test statistic

$$\boxed{\chi^2 = \sum_{i}\sum_{j}\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}}$$

### 3.5 Degrees of freedom

$$\boxed{\nu = (r-1)(c-1)}$$

Where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns.

### 3.6 Worked example

**Example.** A survey of 200 people records their age group and preferred news source:

|           | TV  | Online | Newspaper | Row total |
| --------- | --- | ------ | --------- | --------- |
| Under 30  | 20  | 60     | 10        | 90        |
| 30 to 50  | 30  | 25     | 15        | 70        |
| Over 50   | 20  | 5      | 15        | 40        |
| Col total | 70  | 90     | 40        | 200       |

Test at the 5% level whether age group and preferred news source are independent.

**Expected frequencies:**

$E_{11} = \dfrac{90 \times 70}{200} = 31.5$
$E_{12} = \dfrac{90 \times 90}{200} = 40.5$
$E_{13} = \dfrac{90 \times 40}{200} = 18.0$

$E_{21} = \dfrac{70 \times 70}{200} = 24.5$
$E_{22} = \dfrac{70 \times 90}{200} = 31.5$
$E_{23} = \dfrac{70 \times 40}{200} = 14.0$

$E_{31} = \dfrac{40 \times 70}{200} = 14.0$
$E_{32} = \dfrac{40 \times 90}{200} = 18.0$
$E_{33} = \dfrac{40 \times 40}{200} = 8.0$

All expected frequencies $\geq 5$So the test is valid.

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(20-31.5)^2}{31.5} + \frac{(60-40.5)^2}{40.5} + \frac{(10-18)^2}{18} + \frac{(30-24.5)^2}{24.5} + \frac{(25-31.5)^2}{31.5} + \frac{(15-14)^2}{14} + \frac{(20-14)^2}{14} + \frac{(5-18)^2}{18} + \frac{(15-8)^2}{8}$$

$$= \frac{132.25}{31.5} + \frac{380.25}{40.5} + \frac{64}{18} + \frac{30.25}{24.5} + \frac{42.25}{31.5} + \frac{1}{14} + \frac{36}{14} + \frac{169}{18} + \frac{49}{8}$$

$$\approx 4.20 + 9.39 + 3.56 + 1.23 + 1.34 + 0.07 + 2.57 + 9.39 + 6.13 = 37.88$$

Degrees of freedom: $\nu = (3-1)(3-1) = 4$.

Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,4} = 9.488$.

Since $37.88 > 9.488$**reject** $H_0$.

There is strong evidence that age group and preferred news source are not independent.

## Problems

<details>
<summary>Problem 1</summary>
A die is rolled 60 times. The observed frequencies are: 1: 8, 2: 12, 3: 9, 4: 11, 5: 13, 6: 7. Test at the 5% level whether the die is fair.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 1</summary>
$H_0$: The die is fair. $H_1$: The die is not fair.

Expected frequency for each face: $E_i = 60/6 = 10$.

$\chi^2 = \dfrac{(8-10)^2}{10} + \dfrac{(12-10)^2}{10} + \dfrac{(9-10)^2}{10} + \dfrac{(11-10)^2}{10} + \dfrac{(13-10)^2}{10} + \dfrac{(7-10)^2}{10}$

$= \dfrac{4+4+1+1+9+9}{10} = \dfrac{28}{10} = 2.8$.

$\nu = 6 - 1 = 5$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,5} = 11.07$.

$2.8 < 11.07$: **do not reject** $H_0$. No evidence the die is biased.

<summary>Problem 2</summary>
In a $2 \times 2$ contingency table, the observed frequencies are: Row 1: 30, 20; Row 2: 15, 35. Test at the 5% level whether the two variables are independent.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 2</summary>
Row totals: 50, 50. Column totals: 45, 55. Grand total: 100.

Expected: $E_{11} = 50(45)/100 = 22.5$$E_{12} = 50(55)/100 = 27.5$$E_{21} = 22.5$ $E_{22} = 27.5$.

$\chi^2 = \dfrac{(30-22.5)^2}{22.5} + \dfrac{(20-27.5)^2}{27.5} + \dfrac{(15-22.5)^2}{22.5} + \dfrac{(35-27.5)^2}{27.5}$

$= \dfrac{56.25}{22.5} + \dfrac{56.25}{27.5} + \dfrac{56.25}{22.5} + \dfrac{56.25}{27.5} = 2.5 + 2.045 + 2.5 + 2.045 = 9.09$.

$\nu = (2-1)(2-1) = 1$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,1} = 3.841$.

$9.09 > 3.841$: **reject** $H_0$. The variables are not independent.

**If you get this wrong, revise:** [Test for Independence](#3-test-for-independence) — Section 3.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 3</summary>
Explain why the chi-squared test statistic uses $(O_i - E_i)^2 / E_i$ rather than $\sum(O_i - E_i)$.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 3</summary>
The sum $\sum(O_i - E_i) = 0$ always, since $\sum O_i = \sum E_i = n$ (both sum to the total
Number of observations). This provides no information about the discrepancy between observed and
Expected.

Squaring removes the sign, and dividing by $E_i$ standardises the contribution of each category.
Categories with larger expected frequencies have larger absolute deviations, so dividing By $E_i$
gives each category appropriate weight. This leads to a test statistic whose distribution Under
$H_0$ is approximately $\chi^2$.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 4</summary>
Estimate $\lambda$: $\bar{r} = \dfrac{0(15)+1(25)+2(20)+3(12)+4(5)+5(3)}{80} = \dfrac{136}{80} = 1.7$.

Expected (Po(1.7)): $P(0) = e^{-1.7} \approx 0.1827 \to E = 14.62$
$P(1) = 1.7\,e^{-1.7} \approx 0.3106 \to E = 24.85$
$P(2) = \dfrac{1.7^2}{2}e^{-1.7} \approx 0.2640 \to E = 21.12$
$P(3) = \dfrac{1.7^3}{6}e^{-1.7} \approx 0.1496 \to E = 11.97$
$P(4) = \dfrac{1.7^4}{24}e^{-1.7} \approx 0.0636 \to E = 5.09$
$P(\geq 5) = 1 - 0.9705 \approx 0.0295 \to E = 2.36$.

Merge $\geq 4$: $O = 8$$E = 5.09+2.36 = 7.45$.

After merging: categories 0, 1, 2, 3, $\geq 4$ with $O$: 15, 25, 20, 12, 8 and $E$: 14.62, 24.85,
21.12, 11.97, 7.45.

$\chi^2 = \dfrac{(15-20.49)^2}{20.49} + \dfrac{(25-27.92)^2}{27.92} + \dfrac{(20-19.02)^2}{19.02} + \dfrac{(20-12.58)^2}{12.58}$

$\approx 1.471 + 0.305 + 0.050 + 4.378 = 6.204$.

$\nu = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,2} = 5.991$.

$6.204 > 5.991$: **reject** $H_0$. Evidence the data does not follow Poisson.

$\nu = (3-1)(2-1) = 2$.

Row totals: 100, 100. Column totals: 95, 105. Grand total: 200.

Expected: $E_{11} = E_{12} = E_{21} = E_{22} = 50$.

Uncorrected:

Yates' corrected:
$\chi^2_Y = \dfrac{(10-0.5)^2+(10-0.5)^2+(5-0.5)^2+(5-0.5)^2}{50} = \dfrac{90.25+90.25+20.25+20.25}{50} = 4.42$.

3. **Sufficiently large sample:** With very small total samples, even large relative discrepancies

## 5. Yates' Correction: When and Why

### 5.1 The problem with small $2 \times 2$ tables

The chi-squared distribution is a continuous approximation to the discrete multinomial distribution.
For $2 \times 2$ tables (1 degree of freedom), this approximation is poor when expected frequencies
Are small. The uncorrected chi-squared test tends to reject $H_0$ too often (it is too liberal).

Yates' correction adjusts each term by subtracting 0.5 from the absolute difference before squaring:

$$\chi^2_{\mathrm{Yates}} = \sum_{i=1}^{4}\frac{(|O_i - E_i| - 0.5)^2}{E_i}$$

This reduces the test statistic, making it harder to reject $H_0$.

### 5.2 When to apply Yates' correction

- Apply it to $2 \times 2$ contingency tables
- It is most important when the total sample size is small ( $n \lt 40$) or when any expected
  frequency is below 10
- Some exam boards require it for all $2 \times 2$ tables; check the specific mark scheme
- Do **not** apply it to tables larger than $2 \times 2$

### 5.3 Limitations

Yates' correction can be **overly conservative** — it may fail to detect a real association. For
Very small samples, Fisher's exact test is preferred (but this is beyond the A-Level syllabus).

<hr />

## 6. Worked Examples

### 6.1 Goodness of fit: dice fairness

**Example.** A die is rolled 120 times with the following results:

| Face | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Obs  | 25  | 18  | 20  | 22  | 15  | 20  |

Test at the 5% level whether the die is fair.

$H_0$: The die is fair (uniform distribution). $H_1$: The die is not fair.

Expected: $E_i = 120/6 = 20$ for all faces.

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(25-20)^2 + (18-20)^2 + (20-20)^2 + (22-20)^2 + (15-20)^2 + (20-20)^2}{20}$$

$$= \frac{25 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 25 + 0}{20} = \frac{58}{20} = 2.9$$

$\nu = 6 - 1 = 5$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,5} = 11.07$.

Since $2.9 \lt 11.07$**do not reject** $H_0$. There is insufficient evidence that the die is Biased.

### 6.2 Goodness of fit: genetic ratios

**Example.** In a genetics experiment, 200 plants are expected to show a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.
The observed counts are 115, 38, 30, 17. Test at the 5% level.

$H_0$: The 9:3:3:1 ratio holds. $H_1$: The ratio does not hold.

Expected: $E_1 = 200(9/16) = 112.5$$E_2 = 200(3/16) = 37.5$$E_3 = 37.5$ $E_4 = 200(1/16) = 12.5$.

All $E_i \geq 5$. $\checkmark$

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(115-112.5)^2}{112.5} + \frac{(38-37.5)^2}{37.5} + \frac{(30-37.5)^2}{37.5} + \frac{(17-12.5)^2}{12.5}$$

$$= \frac{6.25}{112.5} + \frac{0.25}{37.5} + \frac{56.25}{37.5} + \frac{20.25}{12.5}$$

$$\approx 0.056 + 0.007 + 1.500 + 1.620 = 3.183$$

$\nu = 4 - 1 = 3$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,3} = 7.815$.

Since $3.183 \lt 7.815$**do not reject** $H_0$. The data is consistent with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.

### 6.3 Test for independence: smoking and disease

**Example.** A study of 300 adults records smoking status and whether they have a respiratory
Disease:

|              | Disease | No disease | Row total |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Smoker       | 45      | 55         | 100       |
| Non-smoker   | 30      | 170        | 200       |
| Column total | 75      | 225        | 300       |

Test at the 1% level whether smoking status and respiratory disease are independent.

$H_0$: Smoking and disease are independent. $H_1$: They are not independent.

Expected frequencies:

$E_{11} = 100(75)/300 = 25$$E_{12} = 100(225)/300 = 75$.

$E_{21} = 200(75)/300 = 50$$E_{22} = 200(225)/300 = 150$.

All $E_i \geq 5$. $\checkmark$

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(45-25)^2}{25} + \frac{(55-75)^2}{75} + \frac{(30-50)^2}{50} + \frac{(170-150)^2}{150}$$

$$= \frac{400}{25} + \frac{400}{75} + \frac{400}{50} + \frac{400}{150}$$

$$= 16 + 5.333 + 8 + 2.667 = 32.0$$

$\nu = (2-1)(2-1) = 1$. Critical value at 1%: $\chi^2_{0.01,\,1} = 6.635$.

Since $32.0 > 6.635$**reject** $H_0$ at the 1% level. There is very strong evidence that smoking
Status and respiratory disease are associated.

With Yates' correction:

$$\chi^2_Y = \frac{(20-0.5)^2}{25} + \frac{(20-0.5)^2}{75} + \frac{(20-0.5)^2}{50} + \frac{(20-0.5)^2}{150}$$

$$= \frac{380.25}{25} + \frac{380.25}{75} + \frac{380.25}{50} + \frac{380.25}{150}$$

$$= 15.21 + 5.07 + 7.605 + 2.535 = 30.42$$

Still highly significant ($30.42 > 6.635$).

## 7. Degrees of Freedom: Systematic Calculation

### 7.1 Goodness of fit

$$\nu = (\mathrm{number of categories after merging}) - 1 - (\mathrm{parameters estimated})$$

| Distribution fitted              | Parameters estimated | $\nu$ formula |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Uniform (known)                  | 0                    | $n - 1$       |
| Binomial (known $n$Known $p$)    | 0                    | $n - 1$       |
| Binomial (known $n$Estimate $p$) | 1                    | $n - 2$       |
| Poisson (estimate $\lambda$)     | 1                    | $n - 2$       |
| Normal (estimate $\mu$$\sigma$)  | 2                    | $n - 3$       |

### 7.2 Test for independence

$$\nu = (r - 1)(c - 1)$$

| Table size   | $\nu$ |
| ------------ | ----- |
| $2 \times 2$ | 1     |
| $2 \times 3$ | 2     |
| $3 \times 3$ | 4     |
| $3 \times 4$ | 6     |
| $4 \times 5$ | 12    |

### 7.3 Intuition for degrees of freedom

The degrees of freedom represent the number of independent pieces of information in the data, after
Accounting for constraints. In a contingency table:

- Each row total is fixed, so each row has one fewer free value
- Each column total is fixed, so each column has one fewer free value
- The grand total is automatically determined

This gives $(r-1)(c-1)$ free cells.

<hr />

## 8. Interpretation: What "Significant" Means

### 8.1 In plain language

When we reject $H_0$ at the 5% level, we are saying:

"If the null hypothesis were true, there would be less than a 5% chance of obtaining a test
Statistic at least as extreme as the one observed."

This is **not** the same as saying $H_0$ is false with 95% probability. It is a statement about the
Probability of the data given the hypothesis, not the probability of the hypothesis given the data.

### 8.2 Common misinterpretations

| Statement                                                        | Correct?        | Why                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "There is a 5% chance the null hypothesis is true"               | No              | This confuses $P(\mathrm{data}\mid H_0)$ with $P(H_0\mid\mathrm{data})$                     |
| "The probability of getting this result by chance is 5%"         | Approximately   | More precisely: the probability of getting a result _at least this extreme_ by chance is 5% |
| "We have proved the alternative hypothesis"                      | No              | We have only found evidence against $H_0$; the alternative could still be wrong             |
| "A significant result means the effect is practically important" | Not necessarily | With a very large sample, even tiny deviations become significant                           |

### 8.3 Context matters

A significant chi-squared test tells you the observed data is unlikely under $H_0$But it does not
Tell you **how** the data differs or whether the difference is meaningful. Always inspect the
Observed vs expected frequencies to understand the nature of any discrepancy.

<hr />

## 9. Relationship to the Normal Approximation

### 9.1 Chi-squared as a sum of squared normals

The fundamental connection: if $X \sim \chi^2_1$ (1 degree of freedom), then $X = Z^2$ where
$Z \sim N(0,1)$.

This means $\sqrt{\chi^2_1} \sim |Z|$I.e., the square root of a chi-squared statistic with 1
Df follows a half-normal distribution.

### 9.2 $2 \times 2$ tables and the normal approximation

For a $2 \times 2$ table, the chi-squared test is equivalent to a two-proportion $z$-test. If $p_1$
And $p_2$ are the sample proportions:

$$\chi^2 = z^2 \quad \mathrm{where} \quad z = \frac{p_1 - p_2}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})(1/n_1 + 1/n_2)}}$$

And $\hat{p}$ is the pooled proportion.

### 9.3 Large degrees of freedom

As $\nu$ increases, $\chi^2_\nu$ approaches $N(\nu, 2\nu)$. This means for large tables:

$$z = \frac{\chi^2 - \nu}{\sqrt{2\nu}} \sim N(0,1) \quad \mathrm{approximately}$$

This approximation is useful when chi-squared tables do not list the required $\nu$ value.

<hr />

## 10. Common Pitfalls

### Using percentages instead of frequencies

The chi-squared test requires raw count data. If you are given percentages, you must convert back to
Frequencies using the sample size. Using percentages directly produces a test statistic that is off
By a factor of $n/100$ and gives completely wrong $p$-values.

### Wrong degrees of freedom

For goodness of fit, forgetting to subtract the number of estimated parameters is the most common
Error. For independence tests, using $r \times c$ instead of $(r-1)(c-1)$ will overestimate the
Degrees of freedom and make the test too liberal.

### Small expected values

If any expected frequency is below 5, the chi-squared approximation breaks down. The remedy is to
**merge adjacent categories** before computing the test statistic. Do not discard categories — this
loses information and biases the result.

### Not checking all expected frequencies

After merging categories to fix one small expected value, you must recheck all remaining expected
Values. The merge may create new expected values below 5.

### Merging non-adjacent categories

When merging categories for a goodness of fit, merge categories that are logically adjacent (e.g.,
"4" and "$\geq 5$" in a Poisson fit). Merging non-adjacent categories (e.g., "0" and "5") destroys
The structure of the distribution and makes the test invalid.

### Confusing one-tailed and two-tailed

The chi-squared test is inherently one-tailed (right-tailed only). Large values of $\chi^2$ indicate
Discrepancy from $H_0$. Small values (close to 0) indicate good fit and are **not** significant.
There is no such thing as a "left-tailed" chi-squared test.

<summary>Q1. A die is rolled 240 times. The observed frequencies are 1: 52, 2: 38, 3: 40, 4: 36, 5: 44, 6: 30. Test at the 5% level whether the die is fair, and identify which face(s) contribute most to the test statistic.</summary>

$H_0$: Fair die. $H_1$: Not fair.

$E_i = 240/6 = 40$ for all faces.

$\chi^2 = \dfrac{(52-40)^2 + (38-40)^2 + (40-40)^2 + (36-40)^2 + (44-40)^2 + (30-40)^2}{40}$

$= \dfrac{144 + 4 + 0 + 16 + 16 + 100}{40} = \dfrac{280}{40} = 7.0$.

$\nu = 5$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,5} = 11.07$.

$7.0 \lt 11.07$: **do not reject** $H_0$.

Contributions: face 1 contributes $144/40 = 3.6$Face 6 contributes $100/40 = 2.5$. These two faces

$H_0$: Poisson. $H_1$: Not Poisson.

$\bar{x} = \dfrac{0(12) + 1(30) + 2(35) + 3(25) + 4(12) + 5(6)}{120} = \dfrac{238}{120} \approx 1.983$.

Expected using Po(1.983): $P(0) = e^{-1.983} \approx 0.1379 \to E = 16.55$
$P(1) = 1.983 \times 0.1379 \approx 0.2734 \to E = 32.81$

$P(4) = 1.983^4/24 \times 0.1379 \approx 0.0888 \to E = 10.66$
$P(\geq 5) = 1 - 0.9484 \approx 0.0516 \to E = 6.19$

Merge $\geq 4$: $O = 18$, $E = 10.66 + 6.19 = 16.85$. All $E \geq 5$.

$\approx 1.251 + 0.241 + 0.188 + 0.570 + 0.079 = 2.329$

$\nu = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,3} = 7.815$.

$2.329 \lt 7.815$: **do not reject** $H_0$.

$\nu = (4-1)(4-1) = 9$. Critical value: $\chi^2_{0.05,\,9} = 16.92$.

<summary>Q4. Explain why merging categories changes the degrees of freedom, and calculate the new df when a 6-category Poisson goodness of fit test (with $\lambda$ estimated) has its last 3 categories merged into one.</summary>

Originally: $\nu = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4$ (6 categories, 1 parameter estimated).

After merging the last 3 into 1: we now have 4 categories total (first 3 individual + 1 merged).

New $\nu = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2$.

Merging reduces the number of categories, which reduces the degrees of freedom. This makes the test
Slightly more conservative (harder to reject $H_0$) because the critical value is smaller for fewer
Df, but the merged categories also tend to reduce the test statistic.

<summary>Q5. A $2 \times 2$ table has observed frequencies: Row 1: 10, 40; Row 2: 30, 20. Apply Yates' correction and test at the 5% level. Compare with the uncorrected test.</summary>

Row totals: 50, 50. Column totals: 40, 60. Grand total: 100.

Expected: $E_{11} = 50(40)/100 = 20$$E_{12} = 30$$E_{21} = 20$$E_{22} = 30$.

Uncorrected:

$\chi^2 = \dfrac{(10-20)^2}{20} + \dfrac{(40-30)^2}{30} + \dfrac{(30-20)^2}{20} + \dfrac{(20-30)^2}{30} = 5 + 3.333 + 5 + 3.333 = 16.67$.

Test at the 5% level and explain your choice of degrees of freedom.</summary>

Two parameters estimated ($\mu$ and $\sigma$), so $\nu = 7 - 1 - 2 = 4$.

$H_0$: Data follows a normal distribution. $H_1$: Data does not follow a normal distribution.

$8.5 \lt 9.488$: **do not reject** $H_0$. Insufficient evidence to conclude the data is Non-normal.

The degrees of freedom calculation accounts for the fact that estimating parameters from the data
Makes the fit appear better than it truly is. Each estimated parameter reduces the df by 1 because
It uses up one piece of information from the data.

## 8. Advanced Worked Examples

### Example 8.1: Goodness-of-fit test with merging of classes

**Problem.** A die is rolled 120 times. The observed frequencies are:

| Face     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observed | 25  | 17  | 15  | 23  | 18  | 22  |

Test at the 5% level whether the die is fair.

**Solution.** $H_0$: die is fair ($p_i = \frac{1}{6}$). Expected: $E_i = 20$ for each face.

All $E_i = 20 \geq 5$So no merging needed.

$$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} = \frac{25 + 9 + 25 + 9 + 4 + 4}{20} = \frac{76}{20} = 3.8$$

$\nu = 6 - 1 = 5$. Critical value at 5%: $11.07$.

$3.8 < 11.07$: **do not reject** $H_0$. There is insufficient evidence to conclude the die is
Biased.

### Example 8.2: Test for independence in a 3×3 contingency table

**Problem.** 300 people are classified by hair colour and eye colour:

|        | Blue | Brown | Green |
| ------ | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Blonde | 40   | 20    | 10    |
| Brown  | 30   | 60    | 20    |
| Black  | 10   | 40    | 70    |

Test at the 1% level whether hair colour and eye colour are independent.

**Solution.** $H_0$: hair colour and eye colour are independent.

Row totals: Blonde 70, Brown 110, Black 120. Column totals: Blue 80, Brown 120, Green 100. Grand
Total: 300.

Expected values: $E_{ij} = \dfrac{R_i \times C_j}{300}$.

$E_{11} = \dfrac{70 \times 80}{300} = 18.67$$E_{12} = 28$$E_{13} = 23.33$
$E_{21} = 29.33$$E_{22} = 44$$E_{23} = 36.67$$E_{31} = 32$$E_{32} = 48$$E_{33} = 40$.

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(40-18.67)^2}{18.67} + \frac{(20-28)^2}{28} + \frac{(10-23.33)^2}{23.33} + \frac{(30-29.33)^2}{29.33} + \frac{(60-44)^2}{44} + \frac{(20-36.67)^2}{36.67} + \frac{(10-32)^2}{32} + \frac{(40-48)^2}{48} + \frac{(70-40)^2}{40}$$

$\approx 24.35 + 2.29 + 7.61 + 0.02 + 5.82 + 7.58 + 15.13 + 1.33 + 22.50 = 86.63$.

$\nu = (3-1)(3-1) = 4$. Critical value at 1%: $13.28$.

$86.63 > 13.28$: **reject** $H_0$. Very strong evidence that hair colour and eye colour are
Associated.

### Example 8.3: Yates' continuity correction for a 2×2 table

**Problem.** In a drug trial, 40 out of 100 patients on drug A recovered, and 55 out of 100 on drug
B recovered. Test at 5% whether the recovery rates differ, using Yates' correction.

**Solution.** $H_0$: recovery rate is the same for both drugs.

|        | Recovered | Not recovered |
| ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| Drug A | 40        | 60            |
| Drug B | 55        | 45            |

With Yates' correction:

$$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(|O_i - E_i| - 0.5)^2}{E_i}$$

$E_{11} = E_{12} = 47.5$, $E_{21} = E_{22} = 47.5$.

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(|40-47.5|-0.5)^2}{47.5} + \frac{(|60-47.5|-0.5)^2}{47.5} + \frac{(|55-47.5|-0.5)^2}{47.5} + \frac{(|45-47.5|-0.5)^2}{47.5}$$

$= \dfrac{49 + 144 + 49 + 4}{47.5} = \dfrac{246}{47.5} \approx 5.18$.

$\nu = 1$. Critical value at 5%: $3.84$.

$5.18 > 3.84$: **reject** $H_0$. Significant difference in recovery rates.

### Example 8.4: Determining degrees of freedom with estimated parameters

**Problem.** Data is tested against a normal distribution with mean and variance estimated from the
Data. The data is grouped into 8 classes. One class has expected frequency 3 and is merged with an
Adjacent class. State the degrees of freedom.

**Solution.** Original classes: 8. After merging: 7 classes.

Restrictions: total frequency (1), estimated mean (1), estimated variance (1). Total
Restrictions: 3.

$$\nu = 7 - 3 = \boxed{4}$$

### Example 8.5: Chi-squared test for a geometric distribution

**Problem.** Customers arrive at a till. The number of customers served before the first complaint
Is recorded over 200 shifts:

| Count    | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | $\geq 4$ |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- |
| Observed | 90  | 60  | 30  | 12  | 8        |

Test at 5% whether the data follows a geometric distribution.

**Solution.** $H_0$: data follows $\mathrm{Geo}(p)$.

$\bar{x} = \dfrac{0 \times 90 + 1 \times 60 + 2 \times 30 + 3 \times 12 + 4 \times 8}{200} = \dfrac{196}{200} = 0.98$.

For $\mathrm{Geo}(p)$: $E(X) = \dfrac{1-p}{p} = 0.98 \implies p = \dfrac{1}{1.98} \approx 0.505$.

Expected: $P(X=k) = p(1-p)^k = 0.505 \times 0.495^k$.

$E_0 = 200 \times 0.505 = 101$$E_1 = 200 \times 0.250 = 50$$E_2 = 200 \times 0.124 = 24.8$
$E_3 = 200 \times 0.061 = 12.3$$E_{\geq 4} = 200 - 101 - 50 - 24.8 - 12.3 = 11.9$.

All $E_i \geq 5$So no merging needed.

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(90-101)^2}{101} + \frac{(60-50)^2}{50} + \frac{(30-24.8)^2}{24.8} + \frac{(12-12.3)^2}{12.3} + \frac{(8-11.9)^2}{11.9}$$

$\approx 1.20 + 2.00 + 1.09 + 0.01 + 1.28 = 5.58$.

$\nu = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3$ (5 classes, 1 for total, 1 for estimated $p$). Critical value at 5%: $7.82$.

$5.58 < 7.82$: **do not reject** $H_0$.

### Example 8.6: Interpreting a very small expected frequency

**Problem.** A 2×5 contingency table has several expected frequencies below 5. What action should be
Taken?

**Solution.** Adjacent rows or columns should be merged to ensure all expected frequencies are at
Least 5. The degrees of freedom must be recalculated based on the new table dimensions. If merging
Destroys the structure of the test (e.g., merging distinct categories that have different meanings),
Fisher's exact test should be used instead.

### Example 8.7: Calculating the chi-squared statistic from raw proportions

**Problem.** In a survey of 500 people, 60% prefer tea in the North and 45% prefer tea in the South.
There are 300 Northerners and 200 Southerners. Test at 5% whether preference differs by region.

**Solution.** $H_0$: no association between region and preference.

Observed table:

|       | Tea | No Tea |
| ----- | --- | ------ |
| North | 180 | 120    |
| South | 90  | 110    |

Expected: $E_{11} = \dfrac{270 \times 300}{500} = 162$$E_{12} = 138$$E_{21} = 108$
$E_{22} = 92$.

$$\chi^2 = \frac{324}{162} + \frac{324}{138} + \frac{324}{108} + \frac{324}{92} \approx 2.00 + 2.35 + 3.00 + 3.52 = 10.87$$

$\nu = 1$. Critical value at 5%: $3.84$.

$10.87 > 3.84$: **reject** $H_0$. Significant association between region and tea preference.

## 10. Additional Exam-Style Questions

### Question 8

A tetrahedral die is rolled 200 times. The observed frequencies for faces 1--4 are 38, 62, 55, 45.
Test at the 10% level whether the die is fair.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$H_0$: fair ($p = 0.25$). $E_i = 50$.

$\chi^2 = \dfrac{144 + 144 + 25 + 25}{50} = \dfrac{338}{50} = 6.76$.

$\nu = 3$. Critical value at 10%: $6.25$.

$6.76 > 6.25$: **reject** $H_0$. The die appears biased at the 10% level.

</details>

### Question 9

**Explain** why the chi-squared test is an approximate test and describe when it may not be
Appropriate.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The chi-squared distribution is a continuous approximation to the discrete distribution of the test
Statistic. The approximation is poor when:

1. Expected frequencies are small ( $E < 5$), as the continuous approximation breaks down.
2. The total sample size is very small.
3. The number of classes is very large relative to the sample size.

In these cases, Fisher's exact test or exact multinomial methods should be used instead.

</details>

### Question 10

In a test of independence on a 4×3 contingency table, the calculated $\chi^2$ statistic is 18.7.
Determine whether to reject $H_0$ at the 5% significance level.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$\nu = (4-1)(3-1) = 6$. Critical value at 5%: $12.59$.

$18.7 > 12.59$: **reject** $H_0$. There is significant evidence of an association between the row
And column variables.

## 13. Further Exam-Style Questions

### Question 11

A teacher believes that grades in a class follow a specific distribution: 10% A, 30% B, 40% C, 20%
D. In a sample of 200 students, the observed frequencies are: A: 15, B: 70, C: 80, D: 35. Test at
The 5% level.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$H_0$: grades follow the specified distribution.

Expected: A: 20, B: 60, C: 80, D: 40. All $\geq 5$.

$\chi^2 = \dfrac{25}{20} + \dfrac{100}{60} + 0 + \dfrac{25}{40} = 1.25 + 1.667 + 0 + 0.625 = 3.542$.

$\nu = 4 - 1 = 3$. Critical value at 5%: $7.82$.

$3.542 < 7.82$: **do not reject** $H_0$. The data is consistent with the teacher's belief.

</details>

### Question 12

**Explain** the difference between a Type I error and a Type II error in the context of a
Chi-squared test.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Type I error:** Rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true (false positive). The probability is the
Significance level $\alpha$.

**Type II error:** Failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false (false negative). The probability
Depends on the true distribution and sample size; it is denoted $\beta$And $1-\beta$ is the power Of
the test.

</details>

## 14. Advanced Topics

### 14.1 The chi-squared distribution

The chi-squared distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom is the distribution of
$\sum_{i=1}^{\nu} Z_i^2$ where $Z_i \sim N(0,1)$ are independent.

Key properties:

- Mean: $\nu$
- Variance: $2\nu$
- Additivity: if $X \sim \chi^2_{\nu_1}$ and $Y \sim \chi^2_{\nu_2}$ are independent, then
  $X+Y \sim \chi^2_{\nu_1+\nu_2}$

### 14.2 Chi-squared confidence intervals for variance

For a sample of size $n$ from $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$The quantity
$\dfrac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$.

A $95\%$ confidence interval for $\sigma^2$ is:

$$\left[\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,0.025}},\; \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,0.975}}\right]$$

### 14.3 Relationship to other tests

The chi-squared test is related to:

- The $G$-test (log-likelihood ratio test), which uses $G = 2\sum O_i \ln(O_i/E_i)$
- Fisher's exact test for small samples
- The $z$-test for proportions (for 2×2 tables, $\chi^2 \approx z^2$)

## 15. Further Exam-Style Questions

### Question 13

A 3×2 contingency table yields $\chi^2 = 4.5$. At what significance levels would $H_0$ be rejected?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$\nu = (3-1)(2-1) = 2$.

Critical values: 1% level: $9.21$5% level: $5.99$10% level: $4.61$.

$4.5 < 4.61$: $H_0$ would not be rejected at the 10% level (or any conventional level).

The $p$-value is slightly above 10%.

</details>

### Question 14

**Explain** why merging classes in a chi-squared test reduces the degrees of freedom and may reduce
The power of the test.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Merging reduces the number of classes $k$Which reduces $\nu = k - 1 - m$. Fewer degrees of freedom
Means the critical value is lower, making it easier to reject $H_0$But merging also discards
Information about the differences between the merged classes. If the true deviation from $H_0$ is in
The merged classes, the test loses the ability to detect it, reducing power.

</details>

### Question 15

A goodness-of-fit test of a normal distribution uses 10 classes with mean and variance estimated
From the data. The calculated $\chi^2 = 15.2$. Test at the 5% level.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$\nu = 10 - 1 - 2 = 7$ (10 classes, 1 for total, 2 estimated parameters).

Critical value at 5%: $14.07$.

$15.2 > 14.07$: **reject** $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence to conclude the data does not follow
A normal distribution.

</details>

## 16. Further Advanced Topics

### 16.1 The chi-squared distribution properties

- $\chi^2_\nu$ is the distribution of $\sum_{i=1}^\nu Z_i^2$ where $Z_i \sim N(0,1)$ i.i.d.
- Mean $= \nu$Variance $= 2\nu$
- For large $\nu$: $\chi^2_\nu \approx N(\nu, 2\nu)$ (by CLT)
- Additivity: $\chi^2_a + \chi^2_b = \chi^2_{a+b}$ (independent)

### 16.2 The $G$-test (log-likelihood ratio)

An alternative to the chi-squared test using:

$$G = 2\sum_{i=1}^{k} O_i \ln\!\left(\frac{O_i}{E_i}\right)$$

For large samples, $G \approx \chi^2_\nu$.

### 16.3 Fisher's exact test

For 2×2 tables with small expected frequencies:

$$P = \frac{(a+b)!(c+d)!(a+c)!(b+d)!}{a!\,b!\,c!\,d!\,n!}$$

This gives the exact $p$-value without approximation.

### 16.4 Post-hoc analysis

After rejecting $H_0$ in a goodness-of-fit test, standardised residuals identify which classes
Contribute most:

$$r_i = \frac{O_i - E_i}{\sqrt{E_i}}$$

Values with $|r_i| > 2$ indicate significant deviations.

## 17. Further Exam-Style Questions

### Question 16

In a $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test with 8 classes, 1 parameter estimated, and $\chi^2 = 11.3$Find
The approximate $p$-value.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$\nu = 8 - 1 - 1 = 6$.

From chi-squared tables: $\chi^2_{6,0.05} = 12.59$, $\chi^2_{6,0.10} = 10.64$.

$10.64 < 11.3 < 12.59$So $0.05 < p < 0.10$.

The $p$-value is approximately 0.08.

</details>

### Question 17

**Explain** when it is appropriate to use Fisher's exact test instead of the chi-squared test.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Fisher's exact test should be used when:

1. The sample size is small ( $n < 20$ for 2×2 tables)
2. Expected frequencies are less than 5 and cannot be fixed by merging
3. An exact $p$-value is required rather than an approximation
4. The table is 2×2 (for larger tables, Fisher's test becomes computationally expensive)

## 18. Further Exam-Style Questions

### Question 19

A researcher tests whether a die is fair. In 120 rolls, the observed frequencies are:

| Face | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Freq | 15  | 22  | 18  | 25  | 20  | 20  |

Carry out a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test at the 5% significance level.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$H_0$: Die is fair. $H_1$: Die is not fair.

Expected frequency for each face: $120/6 = 20$.

$X^2 = \displaystyle\sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E} = \frac{25+4+4+25+0+0}{20} = \frac{58}{20} = 2.9$.

$\nu = 6 - 1 = 5$. Critical value at 5%: $\chi^2_{5}(0.95) = 11.07$.

$2.9 < 11.07$So we **do not reject** $H_0$. There is insufficient evidence to suggest the die is
Unfair.
