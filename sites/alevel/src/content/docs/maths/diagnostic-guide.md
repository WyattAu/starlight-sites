# A-Level Mathematics: Diagnostic Test Guide

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the diagnostic testing framework for A-Level Mathematics. The Diagnostic tests
are the hardest questions within the specification, designed to Determine whether a student has
genuine understanding of a topic rather than Surface-level familiarity. They are not practice
quizzes for beginners.

The diagnostic system is partitioned into two categories:

- **Unit tests:** Targeted questions that probe edge cases, boundary conditions, and subtle
  misconceptions within a single topic. Each unit test isolates one concept and applies maximum
  pressure to it.
- **Integration tests:** Multi-topic synthesis problems that require combining concepts from
  multiple units without explicit guidance on which techniques to apply. These mirror the hardest
  questions found on actual examination papers.

These tests are static. They are not interactive. Each question is presented in Full, followed by a
complete worked solution below. The student is responsible For self-marking against the grading
rubric defined in Section 3.

---

## 2. How to Use This Guide

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

1. **Attempt each question under exam conditions.** No notes, no textbook, no calculator unless the
   question explicitly permits one. Time yourself.
2. **Check your answer against the worked solution.** Do not rationalise partial credit that the
   rubric does not award. Be strict.
3. **Mark yourself using the grading rubric.** Apply the definitions in Section 3 without exception.
   Record the result.
4. **Record results in your test matrix.** Use the template in Section 4. Update it after every
   diagnostic session.
5. **Use the test matrix to identify weak areas for revision.** The interpretation guide in Section
   9 explains how to prioritise.

## 3. Grading Rubric

All diagnostic questions are graded on a three-tier system. There is no Numerical score. The tiers
are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

| Grade       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PASS**    | Correct method, correct answer, no errors in working. The solution demonstrates full procedural fluency and conceptual understanding.                                                    |
| **PARTIAL** | Correct method initiated but an error in execution (arithmetic, algebraic, or notational); OR correct final answer arrived at through insufficient, incomplete, or non-rigorous working. |
| **FAIL**    | Incorrect method, no meaningful attempt, or fundamentally wrong approach. This includes cases where the student could not identify which technique to apply.                             |

### Grading discipline

- A single arithmetic error in an otherwise correct solution is PARTIAL, not PASS.
- A correct answer obtained by trial-and-error without demonstrating the intended method is PARTIAL.
- Writing "I don"t know" or leaving the question blank is FAIL.
- Arriving at the correct answer but omitting critical intermediate steps (e.g., skipping the chain
  rule step in a differentiation) is PARTIAL.

## 4. Building Your Test Matrix

### 4.1 What is the test matrix?

The test matrix is a structured record of your diagnostic results. It provides a
Single-source-of-truth view of your strengths and weaknesses across all 24 A-Level Mathematics
topics.

### 4.2 Matrix schema

Each row represents one topic. Each row contains:

| Column                 | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topic                  | The name of the topic                                                                          |
| Unit Test Score        | PASS, PARTIAL, or FAIL                                                                         |
| Integration Test Score | PASS, PARTIAL, or FAIL                                                                         |
| Notes                  | Free-text observations (e.g., "forgot +C on definite integral", "confused scalar with vector") |
| Date                   | Date the diagnostic was last attempted                                                         |

| Unit Test | Integration Test | Diagnosis               | Action                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PASS      | PASS             | Full mastery            | No action required. Revisit periodically.                                                                                                        |

## 5. Unit Tests

### Definition

A unit test probes a single topic in isolation. It targets the hardest questions Within that topic's
specification boundary.

### Design principles

- Each question tests exactly one topic. No cross-topic dependencies.
- Questions focus on edge cases, boundary conditions, and common misconceptions.
- The difficulty level corresponds to the top band of exam mark schemes (A/A\*).

### Example

> **Topic:** Differentiation -- Chain Rule
>
> **Question:** Find dy/dx when y = sin^2(x).
>
> **Diagnostic intent:** Tests whether the student recognises that the chain rule must be applied to
> the outer function (square) and the inner function (sine), rather than applying the chain rule
> once or not at all. A common error is to write dy/dx = 2sin(x), omitting the cos(x) factor from
> the inner derivative.

### What unit tests reveal

- Whether the student has automated the correct procedure for the topic.
- Whether the student recognises when a standard technique applies in a non-obvious form.
- Whether the student has internalised common pitfalls and avoids them.

---

## 6. Integration Tests

### Definition

An integration test combines concepts from multiple topics into a single problem. The student is not
told which techniques to use. Identifying the correct approach Is part of the test.

### Design principles

- Each question draws on two or more topics from the specification.
- The question does not label which techniques are required.
- The difficulty level corresponds to the hardest questions on actual papers.

### Example

> **Topics:** Integration, Vectors, Kinematics
>
> **Question:** A particle moves with velocity v = t^2 i + 2t j. Find the distance travelled between
> t = 0 and t = 3.
>
> **Diagnostic intent:** The student must recognise that distance travelled requires integration of
> the magnitude of the velocity vector (not the velocity components separately). This tests:
> integration of polynomials, vector magnitude calculation, and kinematic understanding of
> displacement vs distance.

### What integration tests reveal

- Whether the student can identify relevant techniques from an unconstrained problem statement.
- Whether the student understands the relationships between topics deeply enough to combine them.
- Whether the student can manage the complexity of a multi-step solution without external
  scaffolding.

## 8. Timing Recommendations

The following time allocations are guidelines. Adjust based on personal pace, But do not reduce
them. If a question takes significantly longer than the upper Bound, that is itself diagnostic
information.

| Task                                         | Time Allocation                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Single unit test question                    | 5 -- 10 minutes                                  |
| Single integration test question             | 15 -- 25 minutes                                 |
| Full topic set (unit + integration)          | 30 -- 45 minutes                                 |
| Full subject area (e.g., all 14 Pure topics) | 7 -- 10.5 hours (split across multiple sessions) |
| Complete diagnostic (all 24 topics)          | 12 -- 18 hours (split across multiple sessions)  |

### Session planning

- Do not attempt more than 4 topics per session. Cognitive fatigue will degrade the validity of
  self-marking.
- Schedule a break of at least 10 minutes between topics.
- Record the date and time of each session in the test matrix for longitudinal tracking.

---

## 9. Self-Assessment Framework

### 9.1 Identifying weak areas

After completing a diagnostic session, scan the test matrix for any row that Contains a FAIL or
PARTIAL. These are your priority targets.

### 9.2 Prioritisation by prerequisite chain

Not all topics are independent. Fixing upstream dependencies before downstream Topics is more
efficient than patching symptoms. The following dependency chains Apply:

```
Algebraic Expressions -> Quadratics -> Equations and Inequalities -> Functions
Differentiation -> Integration
Integration -> Numerical Methods (Newton-Raphson)
Trigonometry -> Differentiation (trig derivatives) -> Integration (trig integrals)
Sequences and Series -> Binomial Expansion
Coordinates and Geometry -> Vectors
Kinematics -> Forces and Newton's Laws -> Moments
Kinematics -> Energy and Work -> Momentum
Data Representation -> Correlation and Regression
Probability -> Statistical Distributions -> Hypothesis Testing
```

**Rule:** If a prerequisite topic has a FAIL score, do not attempt the dependent Topic's integration
test until the prerequisite achieves at least PARTIAL.

### 9.3 Revision cycle

1. Identify FAIL/PARTIAL topics from the test matrix.
2. Sort by prerequisite chain. Address upstream failures first.
3. For each weak topic: review the reference notes, re-attempt the diagnostic question under exam
   conditions.
4. Re-mark. Update the test matrix with the new score and date.
5. If the score improves from FAIL to PARTIAL or from PARTIAL to PASS, proceed to the next topic.
6. If the score does not improve, review the worked solution step-by-step and identify the specific
   point of failure. Re-learn that sub-topic.

### 9.4 Longitudinal tracking

The Date column in the test matrix enables progress tracking over time. Re-run Diagnostics at
regular intervals (recommended: every 2 weeks for topics with FAIL scores, every 4 weeks for topics
with PASS scores). A PASS that degrades To PARTIAL indicates that the material has not been
consolidated into long-term Memory and requires spaced repetition.

```
# Topic Name: Diagnostic Test

## Unit Tests

### Question 1
[Question text]

### Solution 1
[Full worked solution]

### Question 2
[Question text]

### Solution 2
[Full worked solution]

## Integration Tests

### Question 1
[Question text -- multi-topic, no technique hints]

### Solution 1

```

### 10.3 Combined papers

The `papers/` directory contains assembled exam papers that draw questions from Multiple topics,
simulating actual examination conditions. These are optional And should only be attempted after
achieving PASS on the majority of individual Unit tests.

## Appendix: Test Matrix Template

Copy this template into a personal notes file. Populate it as you complete each Diagnostic. Use one
row per topic with columns: Unit Test, Integration Test, Notes, Date. All 24 topics are listed in
the Coverage Map (Section 7).

## Common Pitfalls

- **Misdiagnosing weak areas by topic score alone.** A low score in Statistics may stem from poor
  probability foundations, not statistical testing. **Fix:** Review individual question attempts to
  identify whether errors are conceptual, procedural, or computational.

- **Ignoring the diagnostic timing data.** Spending too long on early questions and rushing later
  ones creates a false picture of ability. **Fix:** Use timed practice from the start; track
  time-per-question to identify areas where fluency is lacking.

- **Treating the diagnostic as a one-time event.** Skills degrade without practice; a single
  diagnostic snapshot misses improvement and regression. **Fix:** Retake diagnostic tests at regular
  intervals (monthly) and compare topic-level scores to track progress.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Weak Areas from Diagnostic Scores

**Problem.** A student scores: Pure 65%, Mechanics 42%, Statistics 78%. Recommend a study priority
plan.

**Solution.** Rank by urgency: Mechanics (42%) → Pure (65%) → Statistics (78%).

Priority 1 (Mechanics): review Newton's laws, connected particles, and moments. Allocate 50% of
study time here.

Priority 2 (Pure): focus on calculus techniques (integration by parts, trigonometric integrals) and
proof by induction. Allocate 35% of study time.

Priority 3 (Statistics): maintain with exam practice papers; focus on hypothesis testing wording.
Allocate 15%.

### Example 2: Diagnostic Question Analysis — Common Misconception

**Problem.** A student answered: "$\int \sin^2 x\,dx = \frac{\sin^3 x}{3} + c$". Identify and
correct the error.

**Solution.** The student incorrectly applied the power rule to a composite function.

Correct approach using the double-angle identity:

$$\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}$$

$$\int \sin^2 x\,dx = \int \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\,dx = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sin 2x}{4} + c$$

This error indicates the student needs to review trigonometric identities and integration
techniques.

## Summary

- Diagnostic tests identify strengths and weaknesses across Pure, Mechanics, and Statistics before
  exam preparation begins.
- Topic-level analysis reveals specific areas needing targeted revision; always review individual
  questions, not just total scores.
- Common error patterns include: misapplying calculus rules, confusion between correlation and
  causation, and incorrect force diagrams.
- Use diagnostic results to create a prioritised study plan, allocating more time to weaker areas
  while maintaining stronger ones.
- Re-test regularly to measure progress and adjust the study plan accordingly.
