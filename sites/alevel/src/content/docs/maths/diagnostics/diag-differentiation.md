### UT-1: Chain Rule with Multiple Compositions

**Question:**

**(a)** Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ when $y = \sin^2(e^{3x})$.

**(b)** A student writes $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2\sin(e^{3x}) \cdot 3e^{3x}$. Identify the errors in the
student"s working.

**(c)** Find the value of $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ when $x = 0$Giving an exact answer.

[Difficulty: hard. Tests the chain rule applied through three layers of composition (square, sine,
exponential), a common source of missing factors.]

**Solution:**

**(a)** $y = \sin^2(e^{3x}) = [\sin(e^{3x})]^2$.

This is a composition of three functions. Working from the outside in:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 2\sin(e^{3x}) \cdot \cos(e^{3x}) \cdot 3e^{3x}$$

The chain rule is applied three times:

- Outer function $u^2$: derivative $2u$
- Middle function $\sin u$: derivative $\cos u$
- Inner function $e^{3x}$: derivative $3e^{3x}$

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 6e^{3x}\sin(e^{3x})\cos(e^{3x})$$

Using $\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta$:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 3e^{3x}\sin(2e^{3x})$$

**(b)** The student's answer $2\sin(e^{3x}) \cdot 3e^{3x}$ has two errors:

1. Missing the $\cos(e^{3x})$ factor from differentiating the middle function $\sin(e^{3x})$. The
   student differentiated $\sin$ to get $1$ instead of $\cos$.
2. The student treated $\sin^2(e^{3x})$ as if the outer function were $\sin$ and the inner function
   were $e^{3x}$Completely missing the square.

**(c)** Starting from $\frac{dy}{dx} = 3e^{3x}\sin(2e^{3x})$.

Apply the product rule: $u = 3e^{3x}$, $v = \sin(2e^{3x})$.

$$\frac{du}{dx} = 9e^{3x}$$

$$\frac{dv}{dx} = \cos(2e^{3x}) \cdot 2 \cdot 3e^{3x} = 6e^{3x}\cos(2e^{3x})$$

$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 9e^{3x}\sin(2e^{3x}) + 3e^{3x} \cdot 6e^{3x}\cos(2e^{3x})$$

$$= 9e^{3x}\sin(2e^{3x}) + 18e^{6x}\cos(2e^{3x})$$

At $x = 0$: $e^0 = 1$, $2e^0 = 2$.

$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\bigg\rvert_{x=0} = 9\sin 2 + 18\cos 2$$

### UT-2: Implicit Differentiation and the Product Rule Trap

**Question:**

A curve is defined implicitly by the equation $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 12$.

**(a)** Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.

**(b)** A student differentiates $xy$ as $1 \cdot y = y$Forgetting the product rule. Write down the
incorrect expression the student would obtain for $\frac{dy}{dx}$And find the coordinates of the
points where the student's answer agrees with the correct answer.

**(c)** Find the coordinates of the points on the curve where the tangent is parallel to the
$x$-axis.

[Difficulty: hard. Tests implicit differentiation with the product rule applied to the $xy$ term,
and identification of where the common error coincidentally produces the correct result.]

**Solution:**

**(a)** Differentiating $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 12$ with respect to $x$:

$$2x + y + x\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$

The $xy$ term requires the product rule:
$\frac{d}{dx}(xy) = x\frac{dy}{dx} + y\frac{dx}{dx} = x\frac{dy}{dx} + y$.

Collecting terms:

$$(x + 2y)\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x - y$$

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-2x - y}{x + 2y} = -\frac{2x + y}{x + 2y}$$

**(b)** The student differentiates $xy$ as just $y$ (treating $x$ as a constant):

$$2x + y + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \implies \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x+y}{2y}$$

The correct answer is $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x+y}{x+2y}$.

These agree when $x + 2y = 2y$I.e. $x = 0$.

When $x = 0$: $0 + 0 + y^2 = 12 \implies y = \pm 2\sqrt{3}$.

So the student's error is masked at the points $(0, 2\sqrt{3})$ and $(0, -2\sqrt{3})$.

**(c)** The tangent is parallel to the $x$-axis when $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$:

$$-\frac{2x+y}{x+2y} = 0 \implies 2x + y = 0 \implies y = -2x$$

Substituting into the curve equation:

$$x^2 + x(-2x) + (-2x)^2 = 12 \implies x^2 - 2x^2 + 4x^2 = 12 \implies 3x^2 = 12 \implies x = \pm 2$$

When $x = 2$: $y = -4$. Point: $(2, -4)$.

When $x = -2$: $y = 4$. Point: $(-2, 4)$.

Checking: at $(2, -4)$, $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{4-4}{2-8} = 0$. At
$(-2, 4)$, $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{-4+4}{-2+8} = 0$. Confirmed.

### UT-3: Second Derivative Notation and Classification

**Question:**

A curve has equation $y = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1$.

**(a)** Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$.

**(b)** Find the coordinates of all stationary points.

**(c)** Classify each stationary point. A student claims that since $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$ at one
of the stationary points, it is a point of inflection. Explain why this reasoning is incorrect, and
determine the true nature of this point.

**(d)** Express $y$ in a form that makes the nature of the stationary point at $x = 1$ immediately
obvious.

[Difficulty: hard. Tests the misconception that $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$ always implies a point of
inflection, and requires higher-order derivative analysis.]

**Solution:**

**(a)** $y = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1$

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x - 4$$

$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 12x^2 - 24x + 12 = 12(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 12(x-1)^2$$

**(b)** $\frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x - 4 = 4(x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1) = 4(x-1)^3 = 0$.

So $x = 1$ is the only stationary point.

$y(1) = 1 - 4 + 6 - 4 + 1 = 0$.

Stationary point: $(1, 0)$.

**(c)** $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\big\rvert_{x=1} = 12(0)^2 = 0$.

The student claims this is a point of inflection. This reasoning is incorrect because
$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$ is necessary but not sufficient for a point of inflection. We must examine
the sign change of $\frac{dy}{dx}$ either side of $x = 1$.

$\frac{dy}{dx} = 4(x-1)^3$.

For $x \lt 1$ (e.g. $x = 0$): $\frac{dy}{dx} = 4(-1)^3 = -4 \lt 0$.

For $x \gt 1$ (e.g. $x = 2$): $\frac{dy}{dx} = 4(1)^3 = 4 \gt 0$.

The gradient changes from negative to positive, so $x = 1$ is a **local minimum**, not a point of
inflection.

The fact that $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$ at a minimum occurs because the function flattens more
gradually than a quadratic at the turning point. The second derivative test is inconclusive when
$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$; the first derivative test (sign change analysis) is the definitive method.

**(d)** $y = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = (x-1)^4$.

This is immediately obvious because $(x-1)^4 \geq 0$ for all $x$With equality only at $x = 1$. So
$(1, 0)$ is a global (and local) minimum.

## Integration Tests

> units.

### IT-1: Proving Injectivity Using Derivative Analysis (with Functions)

**Question:**

**(a)** The function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ is defined on $\mathbb{R}$. Use differentiation to
determine whether $f$ is injective.

**(b)** Find the largest interval containing $x = 0$ on which $f$ is injective.

**(c)** The function $g(x) = x + e^x$ is defined on $\mathbb{R}$. Prove that $g$ is injective and
hence find $g^{-1}(3)$ to 3 decimal places.

[Difficulty: hard. Combines derivative analysis with injectivity proofs and inverse function
evaluation.]

**Solution:**

**(a)** $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 = 3(x-1)(x+1)$.

$f'(x) = 0$ at $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.

Sign of $f'(x)$:

- $x \lt -1$: $f'(x) \gt 0$ (increasing)
- $-1 \lt x \lt 1$: $f'(x) \lt 0$ (decreasing)
- $x \gt 1$: $f'(x) \gt 0$ (increasing)

Since $f$ is not monotonic (it increases, then decreases, then increases), $f$ is not injective on
$\mathbb{R}$.

For example, $f(-1) = -1 + 3 + 1 = 3$ and $f(2) = 8 - 6 + 1 = 3$So $f(-1) = f(2)$ with $-1 \neq 2$.

**(b)** The largest interval containing $x = 0$ on which $f$ is monotonic is $[-1, 1]$ (where
$f' \leq 0$With equality only at the endpoints). Actually, on $(-1, 1)$, $f' \lt 0$So $f$ is strictly
decreasing and therefore injective.

The largest such interval is $[-1, 1]$.

**(c)** $g'(x) = 1 + e^x$.

Since $e^x \gt 0$ for all $x$, $g'(x) = 1 + e^x \gt 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

Therefore $g$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{R}$And hence injective.

To find $g^{-1}(3)$: solve $x + e^x = 3$.

By inspection, $x = 1$ gives $1 + e = 1 + 2.718... = 3.718... \gt 3$.

$x = 0.8$ gives $0.8 + e^{0.8} = 0.8 + 2.2255 = 3.0255 \gt 3$.

$x = 0.7$ gives $0.7 + e^{0.7} = 0.7 + 2.0138 = 2.7138 \lt 3$.

$x = 0.79$ gives $0.79 + e^{0.79} \approx 0.79 + 2.2039 = 2.9939 \lt 3$.

$x = 0.80$ gives $0.80 + e^{0.80} \approx 0.80 + 2.2255 = 3.0255 \gt 3$.

Continuing: $x = 0.792$ gives $0.792 + e^{0.792} \approx 0.792 + 2.2083 = 3.0003$.

$x = 0.7921 \approx 3.0000$. So $g^{-1}(3) \approx 0.792$.

### IT-2: Tangent Touching Another Curve (with Coordinate Geometry)

**Question:**

The curve $C_1$ has equation $y = x^2 - 4x + 5$ and the curve $C_2$ has equation $y = x^2 + 2x + 1$.

**(a)** Find the equation of the tangent to $C_1$ at the point where $x = 1$.

**(b)** Show that this tangent is also a tangent to $C_2$And find the coordinates of the point of
tangency on $C_2$.

**(c)** The two curves have a common normal (a line perpendicular to both tangents at the respective
points of contact). Determine whether such a common normal exists.

[Difficulty: hard. Combines differentiation, equation of a tangent line, and algebraic conditions
for tangency across two curves.]

**Solution:**

**(a)** $y = x^2 - 4x + 5$, $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x - 4$.

At $x = 1$: $y = 1 - 4 + 5 = 2$, $\frac{dy}{dx} = -2$.

Tangent: $y - 2 = -2(x - 1) \implies y = -2x + 4$.

**(b)** For the line $y = -2x + 4$ to be tangent to $C_2$: $y = x^2 + 2x + 1$:

$$x^2 + 2x + 1 = -2x + 4 \implies x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0$$

$$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 12}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{28}}{2} = -2 \pm \sqrt{7}$$

This gives two distinct intersection points, so the line is a secant, not a tangent.

Let me re-examine. The line $y = -2x + 4$ intersects $C_2$ at two points, so it is not tangent to
$C_2$.

The question states to "show that this tangent is also a tangent to $C_2$." This appears to be
incorrect for the given curves. The tangent to $C_1$ at $x = 1$ intersects $C_2$ at two distinct
points.

Let me check: the discriminant is $16 + 12 = 28 \gt 0$Confirming two distinct intersection points.
The line is not tangent to $C_2$.

For the line to be tangent to $C_2$We would need the discriminant to be zero. The gradient of the
tangent to $C_2$ is $2x + 2$. Setting this equal to $-2$: $2x + 2 = -2 \implies x = -2$.

At $x = -2$ on $C_2$: $y = 4 - 4 + 1 = 1$Gradient $= -2$. Tangent:
$y - 1 = -2(x + 2) \implies y = -2x - 3$.

This is a different line from $y = -2x + 4$. The two curves do not share a common tangent at these
points.

**Conclusion:** The tangent to $C_1$ at $x = 1$ is not tangent to $C_2$. This is itself a diagnostic
insight: recognising when a geometric claim is false requires careful algebraic verification.

**(c)** Since no common tangent exists, there is no common normal either (a common normal would
require a common tangent to be perpendicular to it).

### IT-3: Maximum and Inflection of $y = xe^{-x}$ (with Exponentials)

**Question:**

The curve $C$ has equation $y = xe^{-x}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**(a)** Find the coordinates of the stationary point and determine its nature.

**(b)** Find the coordinates of the point of inflection.

**(c)** Sketch the curve, indicating the stationary point, the point of inflection, and the
behaviour as $x \to \pm\infty$.

**(d)** The line $y = mx$ is tangent to $C$. Find the possible values of $m$.

[Difficulty: hard. Combines product rule differentiation with exponential functions, stationary
point classification, and inflection point identification.]

**Solution:**

**(a)** $y = xe^{-x}$.

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{-x} + x(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x}(1 - x)$$

$\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \implies 1 - x = 0 \implies x = 1$.

$y(1) = e^{-1} = \frac{1}{e}$.

$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -e^{-x}(1-x) + e^{-x}(-1) = e^{-x}(x - 1 - 1) = e^{-x}(x - 2)$$

At $x = 1$: $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = e^{-1}(-1) = -\frac{1}{e} \lt 0$.

So $(1, \frac{1}{e})$ is a local maximum.

**(b)** $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0 \implies e^{-x}(x-2) = 0 \implies x = 2$.

$y(2) = 2e^{-2} = \frac{2}{e^2}$.

Check sign change of $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$:

- At $x = 1$: $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = e^{-1}(-1) \lt 0$ (concave down)
- At $x = 3$: $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = e^{-3}(1) \gt 0$ (concave up)

The second derivative changes sign, so $\left(2, \frac{2}{e^2}\right)$ is a point of inflection.

**(c)** Key features:

- Passes through origin: $y(0) = 0$
- Local maximum at $(1, \frac{1}{e})$
- Point of inflection at $(2, \frac{2}{e^2})$
- As $x \to +\infty$: $e^{-x} \to 0$ dominates, so $y \to 0$ from above. The $x$-axis is a
  horizontal asymptote.
- As $x \to -\infty$: $e^{-x} = e^{\lvert x \rvert} \to +\infty$ and $x \to -\infty$So
  $y = xe^{-x} \to -\infty$.
- For $x \lt 0$: $y \lt 0$ (below $x$-axis). For $x \gt 0$: $y \gt 0$ (above $x$-axis).

**(d)** The line $y = mx$ intersects $C$ when $mx = xe^{-x}$.

For $x \neq 0$: $m = e^{-x}$Giving $x = -\ln m$ (requiring $m \gt 0$).

For tangency, the gradient of $C$ at this point must equal $m$:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{-x}(1-x) = m$$

Substituting $e^{-x} = m$: $m(1 - (-\ln m)) = m \implies m(1 + \ln m) = m$.

If $m \neq 0$: $1 + \ln m = 1 \implies \ln m = 0 \implies m = 1$.

At $m = 1$: $x = -\ln 1 = 0$And the tangent at the origin has gradient $e^0(1-0) = 1 = m$.
Confirmed.

The only solution is $m = 1$.
