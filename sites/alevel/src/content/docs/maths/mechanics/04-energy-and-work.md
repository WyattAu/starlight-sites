## 1. Work Done

### 1.1 Definition and derivation

**Definition.** The work done by a constant force $\mathbf{F}$ moving a body through displacement
$\mathbf{s}$ is

$$W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{s} = Fs\cos\theta$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{s}$.

**Derivation.** For a force $F$ in the direction of motion:

$$W = \int_{s_1}^{s_2} F\,ds$$

For constant force: $W = F(s_2 - s_1) = Fs$.

If the force makes angle $\theta$ with the displacement, only the component $F\cos\theta$ in the
Direction of motion does work: $W = Fs\cos\theta$. $\blacksquare$

The SI unit of work is the joule (J) = newton-metre (Nm).

**Intuition.** Work is energy transferred by a force. No work is done if the force is perpendicular
To the motion (e.g., the normal reaction does no work on a body sliding on a horizontal surface).

<hr />

## 2. Kinetic Energy

### 2.1 Derivation

**Theorem.** The kinetic energy of a body of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is

$$\mathrm{KE} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

**Proof.** Starting from Newton"s Second Law:

$$F = ma = m\frac{dv}{dt} = m\frac{dv}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt} = mv\frac{dv}{ds}$$

$$F\,ds = mv\,dv$$

Integrating from rest ($v=0$) to speed $v$:

$$W = \int_0^s F\,ds' = \int_0^v mv'\,dv' = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

This work equals the kinetic energy gained: $\mathrm{KE} = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$. $\blacksquare$

<hr />

## 3. Gravitational Potential Energy

### 3.1 Derivation

**Theorem.** The gravitational potential energy of a mass $m$ at height $h$ above a reference level
Is

$$\mathrm{GPE} = mgh$$

**Proof.** The work done against gravity to raise a mass $m$ through height $h$ is:

$$W = F \times h = mg \times h = mgh$$

This work is stored as gravitational potential energy. $\blacksquare$

### 3.2 Notes

- GPE depends on the choice of reference level ( the ground or lowest point).
- Only **changes** in GPE are physically meaningful.
- When a body falls through height $h$: loss in GPE $= mgh = $ gain in KE (if no other forces do
  work).

### 3.3 Real-world application: roller coasters

Roller coasters are a classic application of GPE. A coaster train is hauled to the highest point
Using a motor (work done against gravity). From there, GPE converts to KE as it descends, and back
To GPE as it climbs the next hill.

**Key insight:** The maximum speed depends only on the vertical drop, not the track shape (assuming
No friction). For a drop of $40\,\mathrm{m}$:

$$v_{\max} = \sqrt{2(9.8)(40)} \approx 28\,\mathrm{m/s}$$

(approximately $100\,\mathrm{km/h}$). Real coasters never reach this due to friction and air
Resistance.

For a loop-the-loop of radius $r$The minimum speed at the top is $\sqrt{gr}$ (from circular Motion).
The coaster must enter the loop with enough GPE to reach this speed at the top:

$$mgh = \frac{1}{2}m(\sqrt{gr})^2 + mg(2r) \implies h = \frac{5}{2}r$$

The entry height must be at least $2.5r$ above the bottom of the loop.

<hr />

## 4. Conservation of Energy

### 4.1 Statement

**Theorem (Work-Energy Principle).** The work done by all forces on a body equals the change in its
Kinetic energy:

$$W_{\mathrm{net}} = \Delta\mathrm{KE} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{1}{2}mu^2$$

### 4.2 Proof from Newton's Second Law

$$W = \int_{s_1}^{s_2} F\,ds = \int_{s_1}^{s_2} ma\,ds = m\int_{s_1}^{s_2}\frac{dv}{dt}\,ds = m\int_{u}^{v}v'\,dv' = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{1}{2}mu^2 \quad \blacksquare$$

### 4.3 Conservation of mechanical energy

If only conservative forces (gravity) do work:

$$\mathrm{KE}_1 + \mathrm{GPE}_1 = \mathrm{KE}_2 + \mathrm{GPE}_2$$

When friction is present:

$$\mathrm{KE}_1 + \mathrm{GPE}_1 = \mathrm{KE}_2 + \mathrm{GPE}_2 + \mathrm{Work done against friction}$$

### 4.4 Work-energy principle for systems

When multiple bodies interact (e.g., two blocks connected by a string over a pulley), apply the
Work-energy principle to the **system as a whole**:

$$W_{\mathrm{external}} = \Delta\mathrm{KE}_{\mathrm{system}} + \Delta\mathrm{GPE}_{\mathrm{system}} + W_{\mathrm{friction}}$$

Internal forces (such as tension in a connecting string) do equal and opposite work on the two
Masses and cancel out. Only external forces and changes in GPE need be considered.

**Example.** Two particles of masses $3\,\mathrm{kg}$ and $5\,\mathrm{kg}$ are connected by a light
Inextensible string over a smooth pulley. Released from rest, find the speed when the
$5\,\mathrm{kg}$ mass has descended $2\,\mathrm{m}$.

Net GPE lost $= (5 - 3)(9.8)(2) = 39.2\,\mathrm{J}$. This equals total KE gained:

$$\frac{1}{2}(3 + 5)v^2 = 39.2 \implies 4v^2 = 39.2 \implies v \approx 3.13\,\mathrm{m/s}$$

Compare with the force method: $a = \frac{5-3}{5+3}(9.8) = 2.45\,\mathrm{m/s}^2$Then
$v = \sqrt{2(2.45)(2)} \approx 3.13\,\mathrm{m/s}$. The energy method avoids solving for tension.

<hr />

## 5. Power

### 5.1 Definition

$$P = \frac{dW}{dt}$$

For a force $F$ on a body moving at speed $v$:

$$\boxed{P = Fv}$$

**Derivation.** $P = \dfrac{dW}{dt} = \dfrac{F\,ds}{dt} = Fv$. $\blacksquare$

### 5.2 Units

The SI unit of power is the watt (W) = joule per second (J/s).

$1\,\mathrm{kW} = 1000\,\mathrm{W}$, $1\,\mathrm{MW} = 10^6\,\mathrm{W}$.

### 5.3 Power and inclined planes

At maximum speed (terminal velocity) up a slope, the driving force equals the component of weight
Plus friction:

$$\frac{P}{v_{\max}} = mg\sin\theta + F_{\mathrm{friction}}$$

### 5.4 Power in variable-force situations

When a body moves under constant power $P$ (e.g., a car with the throttle fixed), the available
Tractive force decreases as speed increases:

$$F = \frac{P}{v}$$

Since $F = ma$:

$$m\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{P}{v} \implies mv\frac{dv}{dt} = P$$

Integrating from rest ($v = 0$) to speed $v$ over time $t$:

$$\int_0^v mv'\,dv' = \int_0^t P\,dt' \implies \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = Pt \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{2Pt}{m}}$$

Speed increases as $\sqrt{t}$ under constant power, slower than the linear increase under constant
Force. This explains why cars feel less responsive at high speeds: the available force at speed $v$
Is only $P/v$.

To find the distance covered:

$$s = \int_0^t \sqrt{\frac{2Pt'}{m}}\,dt' = \sqrt{\frac{2P}{m}} \cdot \frac{2}{3}t^{3/2} = \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2P}{m}}\,t^{3/2}$$

### 5.5 Energy-time graphs and average power

The gradient of a kinetic energy-time graph gives the instantaneous power:

$$\frac{d(\mathrm{KE})}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\right) = mv\frac{dv}{dt} = Fv = P$$

The area under a power-time graph equals the total work done (or total energy transferred).

**Average power** over a time interval $\Delta t$:

$$P_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta\mathrm{KE} + \Delta\mathrm{GPE}}{\Delta t}$$

For a body accelerating from rest to speed $v$ in time $t$ under constant force:

$$P_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2}{t} = \frac{1}{2}Fv$$

This is half the instantaneous power $Fv$ at the end, since velocity increases linearly from $0$ to
$v$ while force remains constant. For constant power $P$The average power equals $P$ throughout.

<hr />

## 6. Elastic Potential Energy

### 6.1 Hooke's law

Hooke's law states that the tension in an elastic spring (or string) is proportional to its
Extension from the natural length:

$$T = kx$$

Where $k$ is the stiffness (spring constant) in $\mathrm{N/m}$And $x$ is the extension.

The force-extension graph is a straight line through the origin. The area under this graph equals
The work done stretching the spring.

### 6.2 Derivation of elastic potential energy

**Theorem.** The elastic potential energy stored in a spring of stiffness $k$ extended by $x$ is:

$$\mathrm{EPE} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

**Proof.** The force varies from $0$ to $kx$. The work done equals the area under the
Force-extension graph (a triangle):

$$W = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times kx = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

By integration:

$$\mathrm{EPE} = \int_0^x kx'\,dx' = \left[\frac{1}{2}kx'^2\right]_0^x = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \quad \blacksquare$$

An equivalent form using the tension $T = kx$ at maximum extension is
$\mathrm{EPE} = \frac{1}{2}Tx$.

### 6.3 Conservation of energy with springs

When elastic springs are involved, EPE must be included in the energy balance:

$$\mathrm{KE}_1 + \mathrm{GPE}_1 + \mathrm{EPE}_1 = \mathrm{KE}_2 + \mathrm{GPE}_2 + \mathrm{EPE}_2 + W_{\mathrm{friction}}$$

### 6.4 Real-world application: bungee jumping

A bungee cord behaves like a spring. As a jumper falls, GPE converts to KE until the cord becomes
Taut. Once taut, the cord stretches and stores EPE. Energy oscillates between GPE, KE, and EPE until
Damping dissipates it.

**Example.** A jumper of mass $75\,\mathrm{kg}$ leaps from a platform $50\,\mathrm{m}$ above a
River. The cord has natural length $25\,\mathrm{m}$ and stiffness $200\,\mathrm{N/m}$. Find the
Lowest point reached ($g = 9.8\,\mathrm{m/s}^2$).

At the lowest point, speed $= 0$. If the total distance fallen is $d$ (where $d \gt 25$ since the
Cord must be stretched):

$$mgd = \frac{1}{2}k(d - 25)^2$$

$$735d = 100(d - 25)^2 \implies 100d^2 - 5735d + 62500 = 0$$

$$d = \frac{5735 \pm \sqrt{5735^2 - 4(100)(62500)}}{200} = \frac{5735 \pm 2809}{200}$$

$d = 42.72\,\mathrm{m}$ (the root $14.63\,\mathrm{m}$ is rejected since the cord is not yet taut).

The lowest point is $50 - 42.72 = 7.28\,\mathrm{m}$ above the river. The jumper is safe.

### 6.5 Real-world application: spring-mass systems

A mass $m$ on a spring of stiffness $k$ (smooth surface) forms a simple harmonic oscillator. At the
Natural length, all energy is kinetic. At maximum extension $A$ (the amplitude), all energy is EPE:

$$E_{\mathrm{total}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^2$$

This gives $v_{\max} = A\sqrt{k/m}$The maximum speed at the equilibrium position.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 10</summary>
At maximum speed: $P = Rv \implies 2000000 = (5000+20v)v = 5000v + 20v^2$.

<details>
<summary>Solution 13</summary>
**Going up:** $\tfrac{1}{2}(2)(144) = 2(9.8)(d\sin 45°) + 0.3(2)(9.8)\cos 45° \times d$.

$144 = 13.86d + 4.16d = 18.02d \implies d \approx 7.99\,\mathrm{m}$.

**Coming back down:** Loss of GPE $= 2(9.8)(7.99\sin 45°) = 110.8\,\mathrm{J}$. Work against
Friction $= 0.3(2)(9.8)\cos 45° \times 7.99 = 33.2\,\mathrm{J}$.

$\tfrac{1}{2}(2)v^2 = 110.8 - 33.2 = 77.6 \implies v = \sqrt{77.6} \approx 8.81\,\mathrm{m/s}$.

The return speed is less than $12\,\mathrm{m/s}$ because energy is lost to friction on both the up

Driving force $= \frac{P}{v} = \frac{30000}{8} = 3750\,\mathrm{N}$.

Net force $= 3750 - 1676 = 2074\,\mathrm{N}$.

$a = \frac{2074}{1500} \approx 1.38\,\mathrm{m/s}^2$.

**If you get this wrong, revise:** [Power and Inclined Planes](#53-power-and-inclined-planes) —
Section 5.3, and [Power in variable-force situations](#54-power-in-variable-force-situations) —
Section 5.4.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--tip">
questions within the A-Level specification for this topic, each with a full worked solution.

**Unit tests** probe edge cases and common misconceptions. **Integration tests** combine Energy and
Work with other topics to test synthesis under exam conditions.

See for instructions on self-marking and
building a personal test matrix.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Neglecting air resistance or assuming ideal conditions when the question specifies a real-world
   scenario.

2. Using the wrong equation from the data sheet. Take time to read the full equation, including
   conditions and variable definitions.

3. Confusing displacement with distance, or velocity with speed, particularly in graphs and
   calculations.

4. Incorrectly applying $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ when forces are not collinear. Resolve into components
   first.

## Summary
