## 1. Surds

**Definition.** A _surd_ is an irrational number expressible as the root of a rational number — that
Is, an expression of the form $\sqrt{n}$ where $n \in \mathbb{Q}^+$ and
$\sqrt{n} \notin \mathbb{Q}$.

The most familiar surds are $\sqrt{2}$$\sqrt{3}$$\sqrt{5}$ And so on. The set of surds is a Subset of
the algebraic numbers, and they arise whenever we solve equations of degree 2 or Higher.

### 1.1 Laws of Surds

For positive real numbers $a$ and $b$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b} &= \sqrt{ab} \\
\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} &= \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} \\
(\sqrt{a})^n &= a^{n/2}
\end{aligned}
$$

These follow directly from the laws of indices (which we prove in Section 2), since
$\sqrt{a} = a^{1/2}$.

**Rationalising the denominator.** If a fraction has a surd in the denominator, we multiply
Numerator and denominator by the surd (or its conjugate) to eliminate it.

For a denominator of the form $\sqrt{a}$Multiply by $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{a}}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{a}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{a}
\end{aligned}
$$

For a denominator of the form $a + b\sqrt{c}$Multiply by the _conjugate_ $a - b\sqrt{c}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{a + b\sqrt{c}} &= \frac{a - b\sqrt{c}}{(a + b\sqrt{c})(a - b\sqrt{c})} = \frac{a - b\sqrt{c}}{a^2 - b^2 c}
\end{aligned}
$$

:::caution
$\frac{a + b\sqrt{c}}{d} \neq \frac{a}{d} + b\sqrt{\frac{c}{d}}$ . Always
distribute the Denominator correctly.
:::
### 1.2 Irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$

**Theorem.** $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

_Proof._ We proceed by contradiction. Assume $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$
Where $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}^+$$q \neq 0$ And $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ (i.e., the fraction is in lowest Terms).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{2} &= \frac{p}{q} \\
2 &= \frac{p^2}{q^2} \\
P^2 &= 2q^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $p^2 = 2q^2$We have that $p^2$ is even. A standard result (proved below) tells us that if
$p^2$ is even, then $p$ is even. So $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

Substituting: $(2k)^2 = 2q^2$ So $4k^2 = 2q^2$Hence $q^2 = 2k^2$.

By the same argument, $q^2$ is even, so $q$ is even. But this contradicts $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ since
Both $p$ and $q$ are divisible by 2. Therefore our assumption was false, and $\sqrt{2}$ is
Irrational. $\blacksquare$

_Lemma._ If $p^2$ is even, then $p$ is even.

_Proof._ The contrapositive: if $p$ is odd, then $p^2$ is odd. If $p = 2k + 1$ Then
$p^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$Which is odd. $\blacksquare$

_Intuition._ This proof exploits the structure of divisibility: the number 2 has a unique prime
Factorisation, and squaring preserves parity. The contradiction arises because $2$ "forces" factors
Of 2 into both $p$ and $q$Making the fraction reducible.

## 2. Indices (Exponent Laws)

**Definition.** For $a > 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$We define
$a^n = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{n \mathrm{ times}}$. We extend this
Definition as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^0 &= 1 \quad \mathrm{for } a \neq 0 \\
A^{-n} &= \frac{1}{a^n} \quad \mathrm{for } a \neq 0 \\
A^{1/n} &= \sqrt[n]{a} \quad \mathrm{(the positive root for } a > 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

### 2.1 Laws of Indices

For $a, b > 0$ and $m, n \in \mathbb{R}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^m \cdot a^n &= a^{m+n} \\
\frac{a^m}{a^n} &= a^{m-n} \\
(a^m)^n &= a^{mn} \\
(ab)^n &= a^n b^n \\
\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n &= \frac{a^n}{b^n}
\end{aligned}
$$

_Proof of $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ for positive integer exponents._

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^m \cdot a^n &= \underbrace{a \cdot a \cdots a}_{m} \cdot \underbrace{a \cdot a \cdots a}_{n} \\
&= \underbrace{a \cdot a \cdots a}_{m + n} = a^{m+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

The extension to rational and real exponents requires more sophisticated machinery (continuity
Arguments and the exponential function), which we develop in
[Exponentials and Logarithms](09-exponentials-and-logarithms.mdx).

_Intuition._ Exponentiation is repeated multiplication, so multiplying two powers of the same base
Adds the counts. Just as $3 \times 5$ counts $3 + 5$ groups of size 1, $a^3 \cdot a^5$ counts
$3 + 5 = 8$ factors of $a$.

<hr />

## 3. Algebraic Manipulation

### 3.1 Expanding Brackets

The distributive law is the foundation: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$.

For two brackets: $(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$.

_Proof._ By applying the distributive law twice:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a + b)(c + d) &= a(c + d) + b(c + d) \\
&= ac + ad + bc + bd \quad \blacksquare
\end{aligned}
$$

### 3.2 Factorisation

Factorisation is the reverse of expansion. The key techniques are:

- **Common factors:** $ab + ac = a(b + c)$
- **Difference of two squares:** $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$
- **Trinomial (quadratic):** $ax^2 + bx + c = (px + q)(rx + s)$ where $pr = a$$ps + qr = b$ $qs = c$
- **Grouping:** $ab + ac + db + dc = a(b + c) + d(b + c) = (a + d)(b + c)$

**Theorem (Difference of Two Squares).** $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$.

_Proof._ Direct expansion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(a - b)(a + b) &= a^2 + ab - ab - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 \quad \blacksquare
\end{aligned}
$$

### 3.3 Factorising Cubics

A cubic $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ can be factorised by finding one root $\alpha$ (using the Factor
Theorem), then dividing by $(x - \alpha)$ to obtain a quadratic, which can then be factorised.

<hr />

## 4. Polynomial Division

### 4.1 Long Division

Polynomial long division mirrors integer long division exactly. We demonstrate with an example, then
State the general theorem.

**Example.** Divide $x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 6$ by $x - 1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
X^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 6 &= (x - 1)(x^2) + \mathrm{remainder of } x^3 - x^2 \\
&= (x - 1)(x^2) + 3x^2 - 5x + 6 \\
&= (x - 1)(x^2 + 3x) + \mathrm{remainder of } 3x^2 - 3x \\
&= (x - 1)(x^2 + 3x) - 2x + 6 \\
&= (x - 1)(x^2 + 3x - 2) + \mathrm{remainder of } -2x + 2 \\
&= (x - 1)(x^2 + 3x - 2) - 2(x - 1) \\
&= (x - 1)(x^2 + 3x - 2) + 4
\end{aligned}
$$

So the quotient is $x^2 + 3x - 2$ with remainder $4$.

More systematically, the division algorithm tells us:

**Theorem (Polynomial Division Algorithm).** For polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ with $g(x) \neq 0$
There exist unique polynomials $q(x)$ (the quotient) and $r(x)$ (the remainder) such that:

$$f(x) = g(x) \cdot q(x) + r(x)$$

Where $\deg(r) < \deg(g)$ or $r(x) = 0$.

_Intuition._ This is exactly analogous to integer division: $47 = 5 \times 9 + 2$Where
$0 \leq 2 < 5$. In polynomials, the "size" ordering is replaced by degree, and the remainder must
Have smaller degree than the divisor.

### 4.2 Why Polynomial Division Mirrors Integer Long Division

The structural analogy is deep. Both are instances of a _Euclidean domain_ — an algebraic structure
Where we can perform division with remainder. In $\mathbb{Z}$The "degree" is the absolute value; In
$\mathbb{R}[x]$The degree is the polynomial degree. The algorithm is the same: at each step,
Eliminate the leading term.

<hr />

## 5. The Factor Theorem and Remainder Theorem

### 5.1 The Remainder Theorem

**Theorem (Remainder Theorem).** If a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $(x - a)$The remainder is
$f(a)$.

_Proof._ By the division algorithm, $f(x) = (x - a) \cdot q(x) + r$Where $r$ is a constant (since
$\deg(r) < \deg(x - a) = 1$).

Substituting $x = a$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(a) &= (a - a) \cdot q(a) + r = 0 \cdot q(a) + r = r \quad \blacksquare
\end{aligned}
$$

_Intuition._ When you plug in $x = a$The $(x - a)$ factor vanishes, leaving only the remainder. The
remainder is the "leftover" that doesn"t contain the factor $(x - a)$.

### 5.2 The Factor Theorem

**Theorem (Factor Theorem).** $(x - a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$ if and only if $f(a) = 0$.

_Proof._

($\Rightarrow$) If $(x - a)$ is a factor, then $f(x) = (x - a) \cdot q(x)$. Setting $x = a$:
$f(a) = (a - a) \cdot q(a) = 0$.

($\Leftarrow$) If $f(a) = 0$ Then by the Remainder Theorem, the remainder upon division by $(x - a)$
is $f(a) = 0$. So $f(x) = (x - a) \cdot q(x)$Meaning $(x - a)$ is a factor. $\blacksquare$

_Intuition._ The Factor Theorem connects algebra (polynomials) to geometry (roots on the $x$-axis).
A root $x = a$ means the graph crosses the $x$-axis at $a$Which means $(x - a)$ must divide the
Polynomial.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
Show that $(x - 2)$ is a factor of $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4$.

By the Factor Theorem, we check $f(2)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(2) &= 2^3 - 3(2)^2 + 4 = 8 - 12 + 4 = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $f(2) = 0$, $(x - 2)$ is a factor. To find the remaining factor, we perform polynomial
Division:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X^3 - 3x^2 + 4 &= (x - 2)(x^2 - x - 2) \\
&= (x - 2)(x - 2)(x + 1) \\
&= (x - 2)^2(x + 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

## 6. Simplifying Algebraic Fractions

### 6.1 Cancellation

$$\frac{ab + ac}{ad + ae} = \frac{a(b + c)}{a(d + e)} = \frac{b + c}{d + e}$$

:::caution
In the denominator is a factor of the whole expression, but the $x$ in the numerator is only one
Term.
:::
### 6.2 Addition and Subtraction

Find a common denominator, then combine:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{x + 1} + \frac{2}{x - 3} &= \frac{(x - 3) + 2(x + 1)}{(x + 1)(x - 3)} \\
&= \frac{x - 3 + 2x + 2}{(x + 1)(x - 3)} \\
&= \frac{3x - 1}{x^2 - 2x - 3}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Problem 3.** Factorise fully $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Try $f(1) = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0$. So $(x - 1)$ is a factor.

Divide $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$ by $(x - 1)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 &= (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) \\
&= (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)

**Problem 4.** When $f(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 + bx - 12$ is divided by $(x - 1)$ the remainder is $-6$ And
$(x + 2)$ is a factor. Find $a$ and $b$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
By the Remainder Theorem: $f(1) = -6$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2(1)^3 + a(1)^2 + b(1) - 12 &= -6 \\
2 + a + b - 12 &= -6 \\
A + b &= 4 \quad \mathrm{--- (1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

By the Factor Theorem: $f(-2) = 0$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2(-2)^3 + a(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 12 &= 0 \\
-16 + 4a - 2b - 12 &= 0 \\
4a - 2b &= 28 \\
2a - b &= 14 \quad \mathrm{--- (2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Adding (1) and (2): $3a = 18$ So $a = 6$. Then $b = 4 - 6 = -2$.

**Problem 5.** Simplify $\left(\frac{8x^6}{27y^3}\right)^{-2/3}$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{8x^6}{27y^3}\right)^{-2/3} &= \left(\frac{27y^3}{8x^6}\right)^{2/3} \\
&= \frac{(27)^{2/3} \cdot (y^3)^{2/3}}{(8)^{2/3} \cdot (x^6)^{2/3}} \\
&= \frac{9y^2}{4x^4}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $27^{1/3} = 3$ and $8^{1/3} = 2$.

**Problem 6.** Express $\frac{2x + 1}{x^2 + x - 6}$ in partial fractions.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
First factorise: $x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{2x + 1}{(x + 3)(x - 2)} &= \frac{A}{x + 3} + \frac{B}{x - 2} \\
2x + 1 &= A(x - 2) + B(x + 3)
\end{aligned}
$$

Setting $x = -3$: $-6 + 1 = A(-5)$ So $A = 1$.

Setting $x = 2$: $4 + 1 = B(5)$ So $B = 1$.

$$\frac{2x + 1}{(x + 3)(x - 2)} = \frac{1}{x + 3} + \frac{1}{x - 2}$$

**Problem 7.** Given $f(x) = x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6$Show that $(x - 1)$, $(x + 1)$ And $(x - 3)$
are all factors, and hence factorise $f(x)$ completely.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
$f(1) = 1 - 1 - 7 + 1 + 6 = 0$ ✓

$f(-1) = 1 + 1 - 7 - 1 + 6 = 0$ ✓

$f(3) = 81 - 27 - 63 + 3 + 6 = 0$ ✓

Since $f$ is degree 4 with three known linear factors:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(x) &= (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 3)(px + q)
\end{aligned}
$$

The product $(x-1)(x+1)(x-3) = (x^2-1)(x-3) = x^3 - 3x^2 - x + 3$.

Comparing leading coefficients: $p = 1$.

Comparing constant terms: $(-1)(1)(-3)(q) = 6$ So $3q = 6$, $q = 2$.

$$f(x) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 3)(x + 2)$$

**Problem 8.** Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Assume $\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}$ in lowest terms, $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, $\gcd(p, q) = 1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 &= \frac{p^2}{q^2} \\
P^2 &= 3q^2
\end{aligned}
$$

So $3 \mid p^2$Which means $3 \mid p$ (since 3 is prime). Write $p = 3k$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
9k^2 &= 3q^2 \\
Q^2 &= 3k^2
\end{aligned}
$$

So $3 \mid q^2$Hence $3 \mid q$. But $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ and both are divisible by 3 — contradiction.

**Problem 9.** Divide $3x^3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 8$ by $x + 2$. State the quotient and remainder.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Using long division:

$3x^3 \div x = 3x^2$. Multiply: $3x^2(x + 2) = 3x^3 + 6x^2$. Subtract: $-x^2 - 10x$.

$-x^2 \div x = -x$. Multiply: $-x(x + 2) = -x^2 - 2x$. Subtract: $-8x + 8$.

$-8x \div x = -8$. Multiply: $-8(x + 2) = -8x - 16$. Subtract: $24$.

Quotient: $3x^2 - x - 8$Remainder: $24$.

Verification:
$(x + 2)(3x^2 - x - 8) + 24 = 3x^3 - x^2 - 8x + 6x^2 - 2x - 16 + 24 = 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 8$ ✓

**Problem 11.** Given that $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ is exactly divisible by $(x - 1)^2$ and leaves
Remainder $12$ when divided by $(x + 2)$Find $a$, $b$ And $c$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Since $(x - 1)^2$ is a factor, both $f(1) = 0$ and $f'(1) = 0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(1) &= 1 + a + b + c = 0 \quad \mathrm{--- (1)} \\
F'(x) &= 3x^2 + 2ax + b \\
F'(1) &= 3 + 2a + b = 0 \quad \mathrm{--- (2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Also $f(-2) = 12$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
-8 + 4a - 2b + c &= 12 \\
4a - 2b + c &= 20 \quad \mathrm{--- (3)}
\end{aligned}
$$

From (2): $b = -3 - 2a$.

From (1): $c = -1 - a - b = -1 - a + 3 + 2a = 2 + a$.

Substituting into (3): $4a - 2(-3 - 2a) + (2 + a) = 20$

$$4a + 6 + 4a + 2 + a = 20 \implies 9a + 8 = 20 \implies a = \frac{12}{9} = \frac{4}{3}$$

$$b = -3 - \frac{8}{3} = -\frac{17}{3}, \quad c = 2 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{10}{3}$$

:::tip
questions within the A-Level specification for this topic, each with a full worked solution.

**Unit tests** probe edge cases and common misconceptions. **Integration tests** combine Algebraic
Expressions with other pure mathematics topics to test synthesis under exam conditions.

See for instructions on self-marking and
building a personal test matrix.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Rounding too early in multi-step calculations. Carry full precision through and round only the
   final answer.

2. Forgetting the $+c$ constant of integration in indefinite integrals, or misusing boundary
   conditions in definite integrals.

3. Misreading the question, particularly with 'hence' vs 'hence or otherwise'. The former requires
   using previous work.

4. Losing marks by not showing sufficient working. Always write out each step, especially in proof
   questions.
