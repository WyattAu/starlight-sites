:::info Hypothesis testing requires clear, structured answers. Always state your hypotheses, test
Statistic, critical value/region, comparison, and conclusion in context.

<hr />

## 1. Hypotheses

### 1.1 Null and alternative hypotheses

**Definition.**

- The **null hypothesis** $H_0$ is the default assumption ( "no effect" or "no change").
- The **alternative hypothesis** $H_1$ is what we are trying to find evidence for.

### 1.2 One-tailed and two-tailed tests

- **One-tailed:** $H_1: p \gt p_0$ (right-tailed) or $H_1: p \lt p_0$ (left-tailed).
- **Two-tailed:** $H_1: p \neq p_0$.

The choice depends on the research question. Use a one-tailed test only when you have a specific
Directional prediction **before** seeing the data.

:::warning Choosing a one-tailed test after seeing the data (because the results happen to go in one
Direction) is a form of $p$-hacking and is statistically invalid. The tail direction must be decided
Before the experiment.
:::

<hr />

## 2. Critical Values and Significance Levels

### 2.1 Significance level

**Definition.** The **significance level** $\alpha$ is the maximum probability of incorrectly
Rejecting $H_0$ when it is true. Common values: 1%, 5%, 10%.

### 2.2 Critical value

The **critical value** is the boundary between the acceptance and rejection regions.

### 2.3 Critical region

The **critical region** (rejection region) is the set of values of the test statistic that lead to
Rejection of $H_0$.

### 2.4 Actual significance level

For discrete distributions, the actual significance level may differ from the nominal level $\alpha$
Because we cannot achieve exactly $\alpha$.

**Example.** For $X \sim B(15, 0.5)$A right-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$:

$P(X \geq 12) = 1 - P(X \leq 11)$. We find the smallest $c$ such that $P(X \geq c) \leq 0.05$.

$P(X \geq 12) \approx 0.0176$, $P(X \geq 11) \approx 0.0592$.

Critical region: $X \geq 12$. Actual significance level: 1.76%.

<hr />

## 3. Type I and Type II Errors

### 3.1 Definitions

**Definition.**

- **Type I error:** Rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true (false positive).
  $$P(\mathrm{Type I}) = \alpha \mathrm{ (the significance level)}$$

- **Type II error:** Failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false (false negative).
  $$P(\mathrm{Type II}) = \beta$$

- The **power** of a test is $1 - \beta = P(\mathrm{reject } H_0 \mid H_0 \mathrm{ is false})$.

### 3.2 Relationship

Decreasing $\alpha$ (making the test stricter) generally **increases** $\beta$ (more false
Negatives). There is always a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors.

**Intuition.** Think of a courtroom: a Type I error is convicting an innocent person; a Type II
Error is acquitting a guilty person. Making the standard of proof higher (beyond reasonable doubt)
Reduces Type I errors but increases Type II errors. You cannot eliminate both simultaneously.

<hr />

## 4. Hypothesis Testing Procedure

### 4.1 Standard method

1. **Define** the random variable and its distribution under $H_0$.
2. **State** $H_0$ and $H_1$.
3. **State** the significance level $\alpha$.
4. **Calculate** the critical region (or critical value).
5. **Determine** the test statistic from the data.
6. **Compare** the test statistic to the critical value.
7. **Conclude** in context.

### 4.2 Using $p$-values

Alternatively: 1–3. Same as above. 4. Calculate the **$p$-value**: the probability of obtaining a
Result at least as extreme as the observed value, assuming $H_0$ is true. 5. If $p$-value
$\lt \alpha$Reject $H_0$. Otherwise, do not reject $H_0$. 6. Conclude in context.

<hr />

## 5. Binomial Hypothesis Tests

### 5.1 Single proportion test

**Example.** A coin is tossed 20 times and lands heads 15 times. Test at the 5% significance level
Whether the coin is biased towards heads.

$X \sim B(20, p)$.

$H_0: p = 0.5$, $H_1: p \gt 0.5$. One-tailed, $\alpha = 0.05$.

Under $H_0$: $X \sim B(20, 0.5)$.

Find $c$ such that $P(X \geq c) \leq 0.05$.

$P(X \geq 14) = 1 - P(X \leq 13) \approx 0.0577 \gt 0.05$.
$P(X \geq 15) = 1 - P(X \leq 14) \approx 0.0207 \lt 0.05$.

Critical region: $X \geq 15$. Since $X = 15$ is in the critical region, we **reject** $H_0$.

There is sufficient evidence at the 5% level that the coin is biased towards heads.

<hr />

## 6. Normal Hypothesis Tests

### 6.1 Test for a mean (known variance)

**Example.** A machine fills bags with mean weight 500g. A sample of 30 bags gives $\bar{x} = 497$G.
Test at the 5% level whether the mean weight has decreased, given $\sigma = 6$G.

$H_0: \mu = 500$, $H_1: \mu \lt 500$. $\alpha = 0.05$.

Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N(500, 6^2/30) = N(500, 1.2)$.

$z = \dfrac◆LB◆497 - 500◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{1.2}◆RB◆ = \dfrac{-3}{1.0954} = -2.739$.

Critical value: $P(Z \lt -1.645) = 0.05$.

Since $-2.739 \lt -1.645$We reject $H_0$.

There is sufficient evidence that the mean weight has decreased.

### 6.2 Large sample test for a proportion

For large $n$: $\hat{p} \sim N\!\left(p, \dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}\right)$ approximately.

Test statistic: $z = \dfrac◆LB◆\hat{p} - p_0◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}◆RB◆$.

<hr />

## 7. Interpreting Results

:::warning "Failing to reject $H_0$" is **not** the same as "proving $H_0$ is true." It means the
Data does not provide sufficient evidence against $H_0$. The test may lack power (sample too small,
Effect too weak).
:::

<hr />

## 8. One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests in Depth

### 8.1 Choosing between one-tailed and two-tailed

**Use a one-tailed test when:**

- The research question has a specific directional prediction established **before** data
  collection.
- Only one direction of deviation is practically meaningful.
- The consequence of missing an effect in the unexpected direction is negligible.

**Use a two-tailed test when:**

- You are interested in any difference from $H_0$Regardless of direction.
- You want a more conservative test that is harder to reach significance with.
- There is no strong prior reason to expect the effect in one specific direction.

**Example.** Testing whether a new teaching method changes exam scores:

- One-tailed ($H_1: \mu \gt \mu_0$): justified only if prior research strongly suggests the method
  improves scores, and you would not act on a decrease.
- Two-tailed ($H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$): appropriate if the method is new and could either help or
  harm, and either outcome matters.

### 8.2 Critical region comparison

For a test at significance level $\alpha$The allocation of the significance level differs:

- **One-tailed:** The entire $\alpha$ goes into one tail. The critical value is at the $1 - \alpha$
  quantile (right-tailed) or $\alpha$ quantile (left-tailed).
- **Two-tailed:** $\alpha/2$ goes into each tail. The critical values are at the $\alpha/2$ and
  $1 - \alpha/2$ quantiles.

This means the two-tailed test has a **higher bar** for each individual tail.

**Example.** Standard normal test at $\alpha = 0.05$:

- One-tailed ($H_1: \mu \gt \mu_0$): reject if $z \gt 1.645$.
- Two-tailed ($H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$): reject if $z \gt 1.960$ or $z \lt -1.960$.

An observed $z = 1.80$ is significant for the one-tailed test ($1.80 \gt 1.645$) but not for the
Two-tailed test ($|1.80| \lt 1.960$).

:::info A two-tailed test at level $\alpha$ requires a more extreme test statistic than a one-tailed
Test at the same $\alpha$Because the significance "budget" is split between two tails. A Two-tailed
test at $\alpha = 0.05$ corresponds roughly to two one-tailed tests each at $\alpha = 0.025$.
:::

### 8.3 Effect on power

For the same $\alpha$A one-tailed test has **greater power** than a two-tailed test against an
Alternative in the predicted direction, because the critical value is closer to the null value.
However, a one-tailed test has **zero power** to detect an effect in the opposite direction.

<hr />

## 9. Binomial Tests with Normal Approximation

### 9.1 When to use the normal approximation

When $n$ is sufficiently large, the binomial distribution $B(n, p)$ can be approximated by a normal
Distribution. The standard conditions are:

$$np \gt 5 \quad \mathrm{and} \quad n(1 - p) \gt 5$$

Under these conditions:

$$X \approx N(np, np(1-p))$$

Equivalently, for the sample proportion $\hat{p} = X/n$:

$$\hat{p} \approx N\!\left(p, \dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}\right)$$

:::warning Warning $H_0$), not the observed sample proportion $\hat{p}$.
:::
### 9.2 Continuity correction

Since the binomial distribution is discrete and the normal distribution is continuous, a
**continuity correction** improves the accuracy of the approximation:

- For $P(X \leq k)$Use $P\!\left(Z \leq \dfrac◆LB◆k + 0.5 - np◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{np(1-p)}◆RB◆\right)$.
- For $P(X \geq k)$Use $P\!\left(Z \geq \dfrac◆LB◆k - 0.5 - np◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{np(1-p)}◆RB◆\right)$.
- For $P(X = k)$Use $P(k - 0.5 \lt X \lt k + 0.5)$ in the normal.

### 9.3 Worked example

**Example.** Historically, 40% of students at a school take the bus. In a survey of 120 students, 58
Take the bus. Test at the 5% level whether the proportion has changed.

$X \sim B(120, p)$. $H_0: p = 0.4$, $H_1: p \neq 0.4$. Two-tailed, $\alpha = 0.05$.

Check conditions using $p_0 = 0.4$: $np_0 = 120 \times 0.4 = 48 \gt 5$ and
$n(1 - p_0) = 120 \times 0.6 = 72 \gt 5$. Conditions satisfied.

Under $H_0$: $X \approx N(48, 28.8)$So $\sigma = \sqrt{28.8} \approx 5.367$.

Using continuity correction:

$$z = \dfrac{58 - 0.5 - 48}{5.367} = \dfrac{9.5}{5.367} = 1.770$$

Two-tailed critical values: $\pm 1.96$. Since $|1.770| \lt 1.96$**do not reject** $H_0$.

There is insufficient evidence at the 5% level that the proportion of bus users has changed.

<hr />

## 10. Confidence Intervals

### 10.1 Definition

A **confidence interval** gives a range of plausible values for a population parameter, together
With a specified level of confidence.

**Definition.** A $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for a parameter $\theta$ is an interval
$(L, U)$ constructed from sample data such that, in repeated sampling, $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ of such
Intervals would contain the true value of $\theta$.

:::warning A 95% confidence interval does **not** mean there is a 95% probability that $\theta$ lies
In the interval. The parameter $\theta$ is fixed; it either is or is not in the interval. The 95%
Refers to the long-run proportion of intervals (across many repeated samples) that capture $\theta$.
:::

### 10.2 95% confidence interval for a population proportion

For large $n$ where $n\hat{p} \gt 5$ and $n(1 - \hat{p}) \gt 5$The sample proportion $\hat{p}$ Is
approximately normal. The $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $p$ is:

$$\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt◆LB◆\dfrac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}◆RB◆$$

For a 95% confidence interval, $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$:

$$\hat{p} \pm 1.96\sqrt◆LB◆\dfrac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}◆RB◆$$

The **margin of error** is $1.96\sqrt◆LB◆\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n◆RB◆$Which decreases as $n$ increases.

### 10.3 Connection to hypothesis testing

There is a direct and important link between confidence intervals and two-tailed hypothesis tests:

- A $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval contains exactly those values of $p_0$ that would **not be
  rejected** by a two-tailed test of $H_0: p = p_0$ at level $\alpha$.
- If $p_0$ falls **outside** the confidence interval, then $H_0$ is rejected at level $\alpha$.
- If $p_0$ falls **inside** the confidence interval, then $H_0$ is not rejected at level $\alpha$.

**Example.** Using the bus survey data: $\hat{p} = 58/120 \approx 0.483$, $n = 120$.

$$95\%\mathrm{ CI} = 0.483 \pm 1.96\sqrt◆LB◆\dfrac{0.483 \times 0.517}{120}◆RB◆ = 0.483 \pm 1.96 \times 0.0456$$

$$95\%\mathrm{ CI} = 0.483 \pm 0.0894 = (0.394, 0.573)$$

Since $p_0 = 0.4$ lies inside $(0.394, 0.573)$We do not reject $H_0: p = 0.4$ at the 5% level. This
is consistent with the hypothesis test result in Section 9.3.

<hr />

## 11. Interpreting p-Values

### 11.1 Formal definition

**Definition.** The **$p$-value** is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as
Extreme as the observed value, assuming $H_0$ is true.

$$p\mathrm{-value} = P(\mathrm{test statistic} \geq \mathrm{observed} \mid H_0 \mathrm{ true})$$

For a two-tailed test, "at least as extreme" means at least as far from the null value in either
Direction, so the $p$-value is doubled.

### 11.2 Decision rule

- If $p\mathrm{-value} \lt \alpha$: reject $H_0$. The result is **statistically significant**.
- If $p\mathrm{-value} \geq \alpha$: do not reject $H_0$. The result is **not statistically
  significant**.

### 11.3 Strength of evidence

The smaller the $p$-value, the stronger the evidence against $H_0$:

| $p$-value range         | Strength of evidence against $H_0$ |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $p \geq 0.10$           | Little to no evidence              |
| $0.05 \leq p \lt 0.10$  | Weak evidence                      |
| $0.01 \leq p \lt 0.05$  | Moderate evidence                  |
| $0.001 \leq p \lt 0.01$ | Strong evidence                    |
| $p \lt 0.001$           | Very strong evidence               |

### 11.4 Common misinterpretations

:::warning

- The $p$-value is **not** the probability that $H_0$ is true.
- The $p$-value is **not** the probability that the observed result occurred by chance.
- A large $p$-value does **not** prove $H_0$ is true; it only means the data is consistent with
  $H_0$.
- Statistical significance does **not** imply practical or scientific importance.
- The $p$-value depends on sample size: with a very large sample, even small effects can produce
  tiny $p$-values.
:::

### 11.5 Worked example

**Example.** A factory produces components with mean length 50 mm. A sample of 40 components gives
$\bar{x} = 50.8$ mm. Given $\sigma = 3$ mm, find the $p$-value for testing $H_0: \mu = 50$ vs
$H_1: \mu \neq 50$.

Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N(50, 3^2/40) = N(50, 0.225)$.

$$z = \dfrac◆LB◆50.8 - 50◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{0.225}◆RB◆ = \dfrac{0.8}{0.4743} = 1.687$$

$$p\mathrm{-value} = 2 \times P(Z \gt 1.687) = 2 \times (1 - 0.9542) = 0.0916$$

Since $0.0916 \gt 0.05$We do not reject $H_0$ at the 5% level.

**Interpretation:** If the true mean were 50 mm, there would be approximately a 9.2% chance of
Observing a sample mean at least as far from 50 mm as 50.8 mm. This is not unusual enough to provide
Convincing evidence against $H_0$.

A die is rolled 60 times and a 6 appears 16 times. Test at the 5% level whether the die is biased.

<details>
<summary>Solution 1</summary>
$X \sim B(60, p)$. $H_0: p = 1/6$, $H_1: p \neq 1/6$. Two-tailed, $\alpha = 0.05$.

Under $H_0$: $X \sim B(60, 1/6)$. $\mu = 10$
$\sigma = \sqrt◆LB◆60 \times \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{5}{6}◆RB◆ = \sqrt{50/6} \approx 2.887$.

Using normal approximation: $z = \dfrac{16 - 10}{2.887} = 2.078$.

Two-tailed: critical values $\pm 1.96$. $|2.078| \gt 1.96$So **reject** $H_0$.

There is evidence at the 5% level that the die is biased.

<summary>Problem 2</summary>
A manufacturer claims that 90% of their products pass quality control. In a sample of 200, 170 pass. Test the claim at the 5% significance level.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 2</summary>
$X \sim B(200, p)$. $H_0: p = 0.9$, $H_1: p \lt 0.9$. Left-tailed, $\alpha = 0.05$.

$\hat{p} = 170/200 = 0.85$.

Under $H_0$: $\hat{p} \sim N(0.9, \frac◆LB◆0.9 \times 0.1◆RB◆◆LB◆200◆RB◆) = N(0.9, 0.00045)$.

$z = \dfrac◆LB◆0.85 - 0.9◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{0.00045}◆RB◆ = \dfrac{-0.05}{0.0212} = -2.358$.

Critical value: $-1.645$. Since $-2.358 \lt -1.645$**reject** $H_0$.

There is evidence that the proportion passing quality control is less than 90%.

<summary>Solution 4</summary>
Under $H_0$: $X \sim B(10, 0.3)$.

$P(X \geq 6) = 1 - P(X \leq 5) = 1 - 0.9527 = 0.0473 \lt 0.05$.
$P(X \geq 5) = 1 - P(X \leq 4) = 1 - 0.8497 = 0.1503 \gt 0.05$.

$H_0: \mu = 1000$, $H_1: \mu \lt 1000$. $\alpha = 0.01$.

$\bar{X} \sim N(1000, 40^2/50) = N(1000, 32)$ approximately.

For $X \sim B(20, 0.5)$Find the critical region for a two-tailed test at the 10% significance level.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 6</summary>
Under $H_0$: $X \sim B(20, 0.5)$.

For each tail, we need $P(X \leq c_L) \leq 0.05$ and $P(X \geq c_U) \leq 0.05$.

Lower: $P(X \leq 5) \approx 0.0207 \leq 0.05$, $P(X \leq 6) \approx 0.0577 \gt 0.05$. So $c_L = 5$.
Upper: $P(X \geq 15) \approx 0.0207 \leq 0.05$, $P(X \geq 14) \approx 0.0577 \gt 0.05$. So
$c_U = 15$.

Critical region: $X \leq 5$ or $X \geq 15$. Actual significance level: $2 \times 0.0207 = 0.0414$.

<summary>Solution 7</summary>
$H_0: \mu = 70$, $H_1: \mu \neq 70$. Two-tailed, $\alpha = 0.05$.

$\bar{X} \sim N(70, 12^2/25) = N(70, 5.76)$ approximately.

$z = \dfrac◆LB◆66 - 70◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{5.76}◆RB◆ = \dfrac{-4}{2.4} = -1.667$.

Two-tailed critical values: $\pm 1.96$. $|-1.667| \lt 1.96$So **do not reject** $H_0$.

<summary>Problem 9</summary>
Explain why failing to reject $H_0$ does not mean $H_0$ is true.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 9</summary>
Failing to reject $H_0$ means the data is consistent with $H_0$ but does not prove it. The test may lack sufficient power to detect a real effect. For example, if a drug has a small but real benefit, a small sample may not detect it, leading us to fail to reject $H_0$ even though the drug is effective. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

<summary>Problem 10</summary>
For a test of $H_0: \mu = 50$ vs $H_1: \mu \gt 50$ at the 5% level with $\sigma = 4$ and $n = 16$Find the probability of a Type II error if the true mean is $\mu = 52$.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 10</summary>
Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N(50, 16/16) = N(50, 1)$.

Critical value: $P(Z \gt c) = 0.05 \implies c = 50 + 1.645(1) = 51.645$.

Type II error = failing to reject $H_0$ when $\mu = 52$.

$\bar{X} \sim N(52, 1)$ under the true distribution.

$P(\bar{X} \lt 51.645 \mid \mu = 52) = P\!\left(Z \lt \dfrac{51.645 - 52}{1}\right) = P(Z \lt -0.355) \approx 0.3613$.

So $\beta \approx 0.361$ and the power is $1 - \beta \approx 0.639$.

<summary>Problem 11</summary>
A researcher tests whether a new drug changes recovery time. She uses a two-tailed test of $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$ and obtains $z = 1.85$. (a) What is her conclusion? (b) If she had instead used a right-tailed test $H_1: \mu \gt \mu_0$ at the same level, would her conclusion change? Explain.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 11</summary>
(a) Two-tailed test: critical values $\pm 1.96$. $|1.85| = 1.85 \lt 1.96$So **do not reject** $H_0$. There is insufficient evidence that recovery time has changed.

(b) One-tailed test: critical value $1.645$. Since $1.85 \gt 1.645$We **reject** $H_0$. There is
Sufficient evidence that recovery time has increased.

The conclusion changes because a one-tailed test allocates the entire 5% significance level to one
Tail, making the critical value less extreme. This illustrates why the choice between one-tailed and
Two-tailed must be made **before** seeing the data.

<summary>Problem 12</summary>
A survey of 200 households in a town finds that 45 regularly recycle. The national recycling rate is 20%. Test at the 5% level whether the recycling rate in this town differs from the national rate, using a normal approximation with continuity correction.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 12</summary>
$X \sim B(200, p)$. $H_0: p = 0.20$, $H_1: p \neq 0.20$. Two-tailed, $\alpha = 0.05$.

Check conditions using $p_0 = 0.20$: $np_0 = 200 \times 0.20 = 40 \gt 5$ and
$n(1 - p_0) = 160 \gt 5$. Conditions satisfied.

Under $H_0$: $X \approx N(40, 200 \times 0.20 \times 0.80) = N(40, 32)$
$\sigma = \sqrt{32} \approx 5.657$.

Using continuity correction:

$$z = \dfrac{45 - 0.5 - 40}{5.657} = \dfrac{4.5}{5.657} = 0.796$$

Two-tailed critical values: $\pm 1.96$. $|0.796| \lt 1.96$So **do not reject** $H_0$.

There is insufficient evidence at the 5% level that the recycling rate differs from 20%.

<summary>Problem 13</summary>
In a random sample of 150 voters, 87 support a new policy. (a) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of support. (b) Since the interval does not contain 0.5, a politician claims "a majority of voters support the policy." Is this claim justified?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 13</summary>
(a) $\hat{p} = 87/150 = 0.58$.

Check: $n\hat{p} = 150 \times 0.58 = 87 \gt 5$ and $n(1 - \hat{p}) = 150 \times 0.42 = 63 \gt 5$.

$$95\%\mathrm{ CI} = 0.58 \pm 1.96\sqrt◆LB◆\dfrac{0.58 \times 0.42}{150}◆RB◆ = 0.58 \pm 1.96 \times 0.0403$$

$$95\%\mathrm{ CI} = 0.58 \pm 0.0790 = (0.501, 0.659)$$

(b) The 95% CI is $(0.501, 0.659)$. Since the entire interval lies above 0.5, we can reject
$H_0: p = 0.5$ at the 5% level. However, the lower bound is only 0.501, so the evidence for a
Majority is borderline. The claim is technically supported by the test, but the narrow margin should
Be communicated carefully.

A 95% confidence interval for a population mean is $(48.2, 53.8)$. State whether $H_0$ would be rejected or not rejected at the 5% level for each of the following null values: (a) $\mu_0 = 50$(b) $\mu_0 = 47$(c) $\mu_0 = 54$. Justify using the connection between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 14</summary>
A 95% confidence interval contains exactly those values of $\mu_0$ that would **not** be rejected
By a two-tailed test at the 5% level.

(a) $\mu_0 = 50$: $50 \in (48.2, 53.8)$So **do not reject** $H_0$. (b) $\mu_0 = 47$:
$47 \notin (48.2, 53.8)$So **reject** $H_0$. (c) $\mu_0 = 54$: $54 \notin (48.2, 53.8)$So **reject**
$H_0$.

A sample of 35 students has mean score 62.4 with known population standard deviation $\sigma = 8$. (a) Find the $p$-value for testing $H_0: \mu = 60$ vs $H_1: \mu \gt 60$. (b) State your conclusion at the 5% significance level and interpret the $p$-value.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 15</summary>
(a) Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N(60, 8^2/35) = N(60, 1.829)$.

$$z = \dfrac◆LB◆62.4 - 60◆RB◆◆LB◆\sqrt{1.829}◆RB◆ = \dfrac{2.4}{1.352} = 1.775$$

$$p\mathrm{-value} = P(Z \gt 1.775) = 1 - 0.9620 = 0.0380$$

(b) Since $0.038 \lt 0.05$**reject** $H_0$ at the 5% level. There is sufficient evidence that The
true mean score exceeds 60. The $p$-value of 0.038 means that if the true mean were 60, there Would
be a 3.8% chance of observing a sample mean of 62.4 or higher. This provides moderate evidence
Against $H_0$.

For a test of $H_0: \mu = 100$ vs $H_1: \mu \gt 100$ with $\sigma = 15$, $n = 25$And $\alpha = 0.05$: (a) Find the critical value in terms of $\bar{x}$. (b) Find the probability of a Type II error and the power of the test if the true mean is $\mu = 108$. (c) How would the power change if $\alpha$ were increased to 0.10?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution 16</summary>
(a) Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N(100, 15^2/25) = N(100, 9)$So $\sigma_{\bar{X}} = 3$.

Critical value: $c = 100 + 1.645 \times 3 = 104.935$. Reject $H_0$ if $\bar{X} \gt 104.935$.

(b) Type II error when $\mu = 108$: $P(\bar{X} \leq 104.935 \mid \mu = 108)$.

$\bar{X} \sim N(108, 9)$ under the true distribution.

$$P\!\left(Z \leq \dfrac{104.935 - 108}{3}\right) = P(Z \leq -1.022) \approx 0.153$$

So $\beta \approx 0.153$ and power $= 1 - 0.153 = 0.847$.

(c) If $\alpha = 0.10$The critical value becomes $c = 100 + 1.282 \times 3 = 103.846$.

$$\beta_{\mathrm{new}} = P\!\left(Z \leq \dfrac{103.846 - 108}{3}\right) = P(Z \leq -1.385) \approx 0.083$$

Power $= 1 - 0.083 = 0.917$. Increasing $\alpha$ from 0.05 to 0.10 **increases** the power (from
0.847 to 0.917) but also increases the probability of a Type I error. This illustrates the trade-off
Between Type I and Type II errors.

:::tip Diagnostic Test Ready to test your understanding of **Hypothesis Testing**? The contains the hardest
questions within the A-Level specification for this topic, each with a full worked solution.

**Unit tests** probe edge cases and common misconceptions. **Integration tests** combine Hypothesis
Testing with other topics to test synthesis under exam conditions.

See for instructions on self-marking and
building a personal test matrix.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Misreading the question, particularly with 'hence' vs 'hence or otherwise' — the former requires
   using previous work.

2. Forgetting to check that solutions satisfy the original equation (especially with squaring both
   sides or dividing by variables).

3. Dropping negative signs during algebraic manipulation — substitute back to verify your answer.

4. Losing marks by not showing sufficient working — always write out each step, especially in proof
   questions.
