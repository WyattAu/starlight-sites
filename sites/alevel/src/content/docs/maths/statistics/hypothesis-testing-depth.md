## Hypothesis Testing (Extended Treatment)

This document provides a rigorous treatment of hypothesis testing methodology, including null and
Alternative hypotheses, significance levels, Type I and II errors, one-tailed and two-tailed tests,
And critical regions.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
based on Sample evidence. It provides a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty.
</aside>
<hr />

## 1. The Hypothesis Testing Framework

### 1.1 Null and alternative hypotheses

The **null hypothesis** $H_0$ is the default assumption -- a statement of "no effect" or "no
difference." It is assumed to be true unless the evidence is sufficiently compelling to reject It.

The **alternative hypothesis** $H_1$ specifies what we believe might be true instead. It is only
Accepted if the evidence against $H_0$ is strong enough.

### 1.2 Test statistic

A **test statistic** is a function of the sample data whose distribution is known under $H_0$.
Common test statistics include sample proportions, sample means, and sample correlation
Coefficients.

### 1.3 Significance level

The **significance level** $\alpha$ is the maximum probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it is
Actually true. Common values are $\alpha = 0.05$ (5%), $\alpha = 0.01$ (1%), and $\alpha = 0.10$
(10%).

### 1.4 The decision rule

1. Assume $H_0$ is true.
2. Calculate the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed
   value, assuming $H_0$.
3. If this probability (the **$p$-value**) is less than $\alpha$Reject $H_0$. Otherwise, do not
   reject $H_0$.

### 1.5 Critical value approach

Alternatively, find the **critical value** $c$ such that
$P(\mathrm{test\ statistic} \geq c \mid H_0) = \alpha$ (for an upper-tailed test). If the observed
test statistic exceeds $c$Reject $H_0$.

### 1.6 Interpreting the conclusion

- "Reject $H_0$": there is sufficient evidence at the $\alpha$ significance level to support $H_1$.
- "Do not reject $H_0$": there is **insufficient** evidence to reject $H_0$. This does **not** mean
  $H_0$ is true.

$H_0$; we merely fail To find sufficient evidence against it. The conclusion should always be stated
carefully.

<hr />

## 2. Type I and Type II Errors

### 2.1 Definitions

| Decision      | $H_0$ true       | $H_0$ false      |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Reject $H_0$  | Type I error     | Correct decision |
| Do not reject | Correct decision | Type II error    |

**Type I error:** Rejecting $H_0$ when it is true (false positive).

$$P(\mathrm{Type\ I}) = \alpha$$

**Type II error:** Failing to reject $H_0$ when it is false (false negative).

$$P(\mathrm{Type\ II}) = \beta$$

### 2.2 The power of a test

The **power** of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when it is false:

$$\mathrm{Power} = 1 - \beta$$

The power depends on:

- The significance level $\alpha$ (increasing $\alpha$ increases power).
- The sample size $n$ (increasing $n$ increases power).
- The true value of the parameter (the further from $H_0$The greater the power).

### 2.3 Worked example

**Problem.** A machine produces bolts with mean length $50\;\mathrm{mm}$. The standard deviation is
$0.5\;\mathrm{mm}$. A sample of 16 bolts has mean $50.18\;\mathrm{mm}$. Test at the 5% significance
Level whether the mean length has changed.

$H_0: \mu = 50$, $H_1: \mu \neq 50$ (two-tailed).

Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N(50, 0.5^2/16) = N(50, 0.015625)$.

Critical values: $\bar{x}$ such that $P(|\bar{X} - 50| \geq c) = 0.05$.

$z = \pm 1.96$ for a two-tailed 5% test.

$c = 50 \pm 1.96 \times 0.125 = 50 \pm 0.245$

Critical region: $\bar{X} \lt 49.755$ or $\bar{X} \gt 50.245$.

Test statistic: $z = \dfrac{50.18 - 50}{0.125} = 1.44$.

Since $1.44 \lt 1.96$We do **not** reject $H_0$. There is insufficient evidence at the 5% level To
conclude that the mean length has changed.

### 2.4 Finding the probability of Type II error

Continuing the example above, suppose the true mean is $\mu = 50.2$.

$\beta = P(\mathrm{do\ not\ reject}\ H_0 \mid \mu = 50.2)$

$= P(49.755 \lt \bar{X} \lt 50.245 \mid \bar{X} \sim N(50.2, 0.015625))$

$= P\!\left(\dfrac{49.755 - 50.2}{0.125} \lt Z \lt \dfrac{50.245 - 50.2}{0.125}\right) = P(-3.56 \lt Z \lt 0.36)$

$= \Phi(0.36) - \Phi(-3.56) \approx 0.6406 - 0.0002 = 0.6404$

Power $= 1 - 0.6404 = 0.3596$.

<hr />

## 3. One-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests

### 3.1 One-tailed tests

A **one-tailed test** is used when $H_1$ specifies a direction:

- $H_1: \mu \gt \mu_0$ (upper-tailed): critical region in the upper tail.
- $H_1: \mu \lt \mu_0$ (lower-tailed): critical region in the lower tail.

The entire significance level $\alpha$ is in one tail, making it easier to detect an effect in the
Specified direction.

### 3.2 Two-tailed tests

A **two-tailed test** is used when $H_1$ does not specify a direction:

- $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$: critical region split between both tails, with $\alpha/2$ in each.

### 3.3 Choosing one-tailed vs two-tailed

- Use a **two-tailed test** unless there is a strong prior reason to expect a specific direction.
- A one-tailed test has greater power in the specified direction but cannot detect effects in the
  opposite direction.
- The choice must be made **before** examining the data.

### 3.4 Critical values table

For a standard normal test at significance level $\alpha$:

| Test type    | $\alpha = 0.10$ | $\alpha = 0.05$ | $\alpha = 0.01$ |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Two-tailed   | $\pm 1.645$     | $\pm 1.960$     | $\pm 2.576$     |
| Upper-tailed | $1.282$         | $1.645$         | $2.326$         |
| Lower-tailed | $-1.282$        | $-1.645$        | $-2.326$        |

<hr />

## 4. Hypothesis Tests for the Binomial Proportion

### 4.1 Setting up the test

To test whether a population proportion $p$ equals a specified value $p_0$:

$$H_0: p = p_0, \qquad H_1: p \neq p_0\ (\mathrm{or}\ p \gt p_0\ \mathrm{or}\ p \lt p_0)$$

Under $H_0$If $X$ is the number of successes in $n$ trials, then $X \sim B(n, p_0)$.

### 4.2 Worked example: binomial test

**Problem.** A coin is tossed 20 times and lands heads 15 times. Test at the 5% significance level
Whether the coin is biased.

$H_0: p = 0.5$, $H_1: p \neq 0.5$ (two-tailed).

Under $H_0$: $X \sim B(20, 0.5)$.

For a two-tailed test at 5%, we need the critical region in each tail to have probability
$\leq 0.025$.

**Lower tail:** $P(X \leq k) \leq 0.025$.

$P(X \leq 5) = 0.0207 \leq 0.025$. So $k = 5$ (critical region: $X \leq 5$).

**Upper tail:** $P(X \geq k) \leq 0.025$.

$P(X \geq 15) = P(X \leq 5) = 0.0207 \leq 0.025$. So $k = 15$ (critical region: $X \geq 15$).

Since $X = 15$ falls in the critical region, we **reject** $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence at
The 5% level to conclude the coin is biased.

### 4.3 Finding the actual significance level

The actual significance level is the probability of being in the critical region under $H_0$:

$$\alpha_{\mathrm{actual}} = P(X \leq 5) + P(X \geq 15) = 2(0.0207) = 0.0414$$

This is approximately 4.14%, which is the closest we can get to 5% with a discrete distribution.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
nominal level. The Critical region is chosen so that $P(\mathrm{critical\ region} \mid H_0)$ does
not exceed $\alpha$ And is as close as possible to $\alpha$.

<hr />

## 5. Critical Regions

### 5.1 Definition

The **critical region** (or rejection region) is the set of values of the test statistic that lead
To rejection of $H_0$. The **acceptance region** is its complement.

### 5.2 Finding the critical region

**Procedure:**

1. Identify the distribution of the test statistic under $H_0$.
2. Determine whether the test is one-tailed or two-tailed.
3. Find the smallest region containing the most extreme values whose total probability under $H_0$
   does not exceed $\alpha$.

### 5.3 Worked example: Poisson critical region

**Problem.** A receptionist receives on average 2 calls per 5 minutes. Over a 5-minute period, she
Receives 7 calls. Test at the 5% level whether the rate has increased.

$H_0: \lambda = 2$, $H_1: \lambda \gt 2$ (upper-tailed).

Under $H_0$: $X \sim \mathrm{Po}(2)$.

Critical region: smallest $k$ such that $P(X \geq k) \leq 0.05$.

$P(X \geq 5) = 1 - P(X \leq 4) = 1 - e^{-2}\!\left(1 + 2 + 2 + \frac{4}{3} + \frac{2}{3}\right) = 1 - e^{-2} \times 7.667 = 1 - 0.9473 = 0.0527$

$P(X \geq 6) = 1 - P(X \leq 5) = 1 - 0.9835 = 0.0165 \leq 0.05$

Critical region: $X \geq 6$. Actual significance level: $1.65\%$.

Since $X = 7 \geq 6$We **reject** $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence that the call rate has
Increased.

### 5.4 Worked example: normal critical region

**Problem.** The masses of packets of biscuits are normally distributed with standard deviation
$3\;\mathrm{g}$. A sample of 10 packets has mean mass $248\;\mathrm{g}$. Find the critical region
For testing whether the mean mass is less than $250\;\mathrm{g}$ at the 1% significance level.

$H_0: \mu = 250$, $H_1: \mu \lt 250$.

Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N(250, 3^2/10) = N(250, 0.9)$.

$P(\bar{X} \lt c) = 0.01 \implies \dfrac{c - 250}{\sqrt{0.9}} = -2.326$

$c = 250 - 2.326\sqrt{0.9} = 250 - 2.208 = 247.79$

Critical region: $\bar{X} \lt 247.79$.

Since $\bar{x} = 248 \gt 247.79$We do **not** reject $H_0$ at the 1% level.

<hr />

## 6. Practice Problems

### Problem 1

A die is rolled 30 times and a six appears 9 times. Test at the 5% significance level whether the
Die is biased towards showing a six.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$H_0: p = 1/6$, $H_1: p \gt 1/6$ (upper-tailed).

$X \sim B(30, 1/6)$.

Find smallest $k$: $P(X \geq k) \leq 0.05$.

$P(X \geq 9) = 1 - P(X \leq 8)$.

$P(X \leq 8) = \displaystyle\sum_{r=0}^{8}\binom{30}{r}(1/6)^r(5/6)^{30-r} \approx 0.9502$.

$P(X \geq 9) \approx 0.0498 \leq 0.05$.

Since $X = 9$ is in the critical region, reject $H_0$. Sufficient evidence the die is biased Towards
six.

</details>

### Problem 2

A manufacturer claims that the mean lifetime of a component is 500 hours. A sample of 25 components
Has mean lifetime 490 hours with standard deviation 15 hours. Test the claim at the 5% significance
Level.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$H_0: \mu = 500$, $H_1: \mu \neq 500$ (two-tailed).

$\bar{X} \sim N(500, 15^2/25) = N(500, 9)$ approximately.

$z = \dfrac{490 - 500}{3} = -3.33$.

Critical values: $\pm 1.96$.

Since $|-3.33| = 3.33 \gt 1.96$Reject $H_0$. Sufficient evidence the mean lifetime differs from 500
hours.

</details>

### Problem 3

The number of accidents per week at a factory is thought to follow a Poisson distribution with
mean 3. In a particular week, 8 accidents occur. Test at the 5% level whether the accident rate has
Increased.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$H_0: \lambda = 3$, $H_1: \lambda \gt 3$.

$X \sim \mathrm{Po}(3)$.

$P(X \geq 7) = 1 - P(X \leq 6) \approx 1 - 0.9665 = 0.0335 \leq 0.05$.

$P(X \geq 6) = 1 - P(X \leq 5) \approx 1 - 0.9161 = 0.0839 \gt 0.05$.

Critical region: $X \geq 7$. Since $X = 8 \geq 7$Reject $H_0$. Sufficient evidence the rate Has
increased.

</details>

### Problem 4

In a hypothesis test with $H_0: p = 0.4$ and $H_1: p \gt 0.4$ based on a sample of size 20, Find:
(a) the critical region at the 5% level; (b) the actual significance level; (c) the Probability of a
Type II error if the true $p = 0.6$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Under $H_0$: $X \sim B(20, 0.4)$.

(a) $P(X \geq 11) = 1 - P(X \leq 10) \approx 1 - 0.9435 = 0.0565 \gt 0.05$.

$P(X \geq 12) = 1 - P(X \leq 11) \approx 1 - 0.9790 = 0.0210 \leq 0.05$.

Critical region: $X \geq 12$.

(b) Actual significance level $\approx 2.10\%$.

(c) Under $p = 0.6$: $X \sim B(20, 0.6)$.

$\beta = P(X \leq 11 \mid p = 0.6) \approx 0.4044$.

</details>

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing the domain and range of functions, or not considering restrictions (e.g., denominator
   cannot be zero).

2. Losing marks by not showing sufficient working. Always write out each step, especially in proof
   questions.

3. Misreading the question, particularly with "hence' vs 'hence or otherwise'. The former requires
   using previous work.

4. Rounding too early in multi-step calculations. Carry full precision through and round only the
   final answer.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: One-Tailed Binomial Test

**Problem.** A coin is tossed 20 times and 15 heads are observed. Test at the 5% significance level
whether the coin is biased towards heads.

**Solution.** $H_0: p = 0.5$, $H_1: p > 0.5$. Under $H_0$: $X \sim B(20, 0.5)$.

$P(X \geq 15) = P(X = 15) + P(X = 16) + \ldots + P(X = 20)$.

$P(X \geq 15) = \binom{20}{15}(0.5)^{20} + \binom{20}{16}(0.5)^{20} + \ldots + \binom{20}{20}(0.5)^{20}$.

$$P(X \geq 15) = (15504 + 4845 + 1140 + 190 + 20 + 1) \times (0.5)^{20} = 21700 \times 9.537 \times 10^{-7} \approx 0.0207$$

Since $0.0207 < 0.05$, we reject $H_0$. There is significant evidence that the coin is biased
towards heads.

$\blacksquare$

### Example 2: Normal Hypothesis Test for the Mean

**Problem.** A machine fills packets with a mean weight of $500\ \mathrm{g}$ and standard deviation
$12\ \mathrm{g}$. A sample of 36 packets has mean $503.5\ \mathrm{g}$. Test at the 1% level whether
the mean has increased.

**Solution.** $H_0: \mu = 500$, $H_1: \mu > 500$.

Under $H_0$: $\bar{X} \sim N\!\left(500, \frac{144}{36}\right) = N(500, 4)$.

Test statistic: $z = \frac{503.5 - 500}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75$.

One-tailed critical value at 1%: $z_{0.01} = 2.326$.

Since $1.75 < 2.326$, we do not reject $H_0$. There is insufficient evidence that the mean has
increased.

$\blacksquare$

## Summary

- Hypothesis testing: state $H_0$ and $H_1$, choose significance level, calculate test statistic,
  compare with critical value.
- Type I error: rejecting $H_0$ when it is true (probability $= \alpha$).
- Type II error: failing to reject $H_0$ when it is false (probability $= \beta$).
- For binomial tests, use cumulative probabilities; for normal tests, use the $z$-score.
- The critical region is the set of values that lead to rejection of $H_0$.

## Intuition

Mathematics is the study of structure, quantity, and change. Algebra provides symbols for unknown quantities, geometry describes spatial relationships, and calculus captures motion and growth. Together, these branches form a powerful toolkit for solving problems that range from calculating areas to predicting population dynamics. Mathematical literacy is essential for science, technology, and informed citizenship.
