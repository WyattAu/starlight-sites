## A-Level Physics Diagnostic Guide

## Overview

This diagnostic suite contains 20 topic-level tests for A-Level Physics. Each test comprises 3 unit
tests (single-topic, maximum difficulty) and 3 integration tests (multi-topic synthesis). The
questions target the hardest material within the A-Level specification and are designed to expose
deep misconceptions.

## Prerequisite Chains

**Critical dependency notes:**

- Kinematics must be mastered before Dynamics.
- Dynamics underpins Work-Energy, Momentum, Circular Motion, and Oscillations.
- Electric Fields is required before Magnetic Fields and Electromagnetism Unification.
- Superposition and Interference requires Wave Properties.
- Nuclear Energy builds on Radioactivity.

## Grading Rubric

### Per-Question Scoring

Each question (unit or integration) is scored on a 0--4 scale:

| Score | Descriptor                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | No meaningful attempt, or fundamental misconception evident  |
| 1     | Correct approach identified but major errors in execution    |
| 2     | Substantially correct method with one significant error      |
| 3     | Correct method, minor arithmetical or notational error       |
| 4     | Fully correct solution with appropriate working and sig figs |

### Diagnostic Classification

For each topic test (6 questions, max 24 marks):

| Total Score | Classification  | Interpretation                                         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22--24      | **Secure**      | Topic fully mastered; ready for extension              |
| 18--21      | **Proficient**  | Sound understanding; minor gaps to address             |
| 13--17      | **Developing**  | Core concepts present but inconsistent application     |
| 8--12       | **Emerging**    | Significant gaps; foundational revision needed         |
| 0--7        | **Not Started** | Major revision required; return to prerequisite topics |

### Unit vs Integration Analysis

- **Unit test score significantly higher than integration score**: Student can apply procedures in
  isolation but struggles with cross-topic synthesis. Focus on mixed-topic practice.
- **Integration test score higher than unit test score**: Unusual but may indicate stronger
  conceptual understanding than procedural fluency. Focus on technique.
- **Both scores low**: Return to prerequisite chain and rebuild from earlier topics.

### Recommended Diagnostic Workflow

1. Begin with `diag-quantities-units.md`. If score is below 13, revise before proceeding.
2. Work through prerequisite chains in order.
3. After completing a topic, attempt its integration tests to check cross-topic fluency.
4. Revisit any topic where the gap between unit and integration scores exceeds 4 marks.
5. Use the prerequisite chains to identify whether a low score stems from an earlier topic.
