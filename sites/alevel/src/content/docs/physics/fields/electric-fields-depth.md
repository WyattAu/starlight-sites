## Electric Fields

> **Info:** Board Coverage AQA Paper 2 | Edexcel CP3 | OCR (A) Paper 2 | CIE P4
## 1. Coulomb"s Law

**Coulomb's Law.** The electrostatic force between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by
Distance $r$ in vacuum is:

$$\boxed{F = \frac◆LB◆q_1 q_2◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2◆RB◆}$$

Where $\varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12}$ F m$^{-1}$ is the permittivity of free space and
$k = 1/(4\pi\varepsilon_0) = 8.99 \times 10^9$ N m$^2$ C$^{-2}$ is Coulomb's constant.

The force is **repulsive** for like charges and **attractive** for opposite charges, directed along
the Line joining them.

### Superposition Principle

The net force on a charge due to multiple other charges is the **vector sum** of the individual
Coulomb forces:

$$\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}} = \sum_i \frac◆LB◆q\,q_i◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_i^2◆RB◆\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}_i$$

This linearity is fundamental: each pair of charges interacts independently of all others.

### Comparison with Gravitational Force

| Property          | Gravitational              | Electrostatic           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Law               | $F = Gm_1m_2/r^2$          | $F = kq_1q_2/r^2$       |
| Constant          | $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}$ | $k = 8.99 \times 10^9$  |
| Nature            | Always attractive          | Attractive or repulsive |
| Acts on           | Mass                       | Charge                  |
| Relative strength | Very weak                  | Very strong             |

The electrostatic force is approximately $10^{36}$ times stronger than gravity for proton--proton
Interactions. This enormous ratio explains why atomic and molecular structure is governed entirely
by Electromagnetic forces.

## 2. Electric Field Strength

**Definition.** The electric field strength $\mathbf{E}$ at a point is the force per unit positive
Charge:

$$\boxed{\mathbf{E} = \frac◆LB◆\mathbf{F}◆RB◆◆LB◆q◆RB◆}$$

SI units: N C$^{-1}$Equivalent to V m$^{-1}$.

### Field of a Point Charge

$$\boxed{E = \frac◆LB◆Q◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2◆RB◆}$$

**Proof.** Place test charge $q$ at distance $r$ from $Q$. By Coulomb's law:
$F = Qq/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2)$. Therefore $E = F/q = Q/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2)$. $\square$

The field points radially outward from a positive charge and radially inward toward a negative
charge.

### Uniform Electric Field Between Parallel Plates

$$\boxed{E = \frac{V}{d}}$$

Where $V$ is the potential difference and $d$ is the plate separation.

**Proof.** A charge $q$ between the plates experiences force $F = qE$. Work done moving from one
plate To the other: $W = Fd = qEd$. But also $W = qV$. Therefore $qEd = qV$Giving $E = V/d$.
$\square$

The field is uniform (constant magnitude and direction) between the plates, with fringe effects at
the Edges.

### Electric Field Lines

Field lines provide a visual representation of the electric field:

- The direction of the line at any point gives the direction of $\mathbf{E}$.
- The density of lines is proportional to the field strength.
- Lines begin on positive charges and end on negative charges.
- Lines never cross (the field has a unique direction at every point).
- Lines are perpendicular to conducting surfaces at equilibrium.

## 3. Electric Potential

**Definition.** The electric potential $V$ at a point is the work done per unit positive charge in
Bringing a small test charge from infinity to that point:

$$\boxed{V = \frac◆LB◆Q◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r◆RB◆}$$

SI units: volts (V), where 1 V = 1 J C$^{-1}$.

### Derivation from Coulomb's Law

$$V = \frac{W}{q} = \frac{1}{q}\int_{\infty}^{r}\frac◆LB◆Qq◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r'^2◆RB◆\,dr' = \frac◆LB◆Q◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0◆RB◆\left[-\frac{1}{r'}\right]_{\infty}^{r} = \frac◆LB◆Q◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r◆RB◆$$

$\square$

**Sign convention.** Potential is positive near a positive charge (work must be done against
repulsion) And negative near a negative charge (the field does work). Potential decreases with
distance, Approaching zero at infinity.

### Field--Potential Relationship

$$\boxed{E = -\frac{dV}{dr}}$$

**Proof.** Consider a test charge $q$ moved by $dr$ in the direction of the field. Work done by the
Field: $dW = qE\,dr$. This equals the loss in potential energy: $dW = -q\,dV$. Therefore
$qE\,dr = -q\,dV$Giving $E = -dV/dr$. $\square$

The minus sign means the field points in the direction of decreasing potential.

**Verification for a point charge.** $V = Q/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 r)$.

$-\frac{dV}{dr} = -\frac◆LB◆Q◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0◆RB◆\left(-\frac{1}{r^2}\right) = \frac◆LB◆Q◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2◆RB◆ = E\quad\checkmark$

### Electric Potential Energy

$$\boxed{U = \frac◆LB◆q_1 q_2◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0 r◆RB◆}$$

This is the work required to bring two charges from infinite separation to distance $r$.

## 4. Equipotential Surfaces

**Definition.** An equipotential surface is a surface on which every point has the same electric
Potential.

### Properties

1. **No work is done** moving a charge along an equipotential surface (since $\Delta V = 0$).
2. The electric field is always **perpendicular** to equipotential surfaces (since $E = -dV/dr$ and
   $dV = 0$ along the surface).
3. Equipotential surfaces **never cross** (each point has a unique potential).
4. For a point charge, equipotentials are concentric spheres.
5. For a uniform field, equipotentials are parallel planes perpendicular to the field.
6. Equipotentials are closer together where the field is stronger (steeper potential gradient).

### Mapping Equipotentials Experimentally

A practical method uses conducting paper with electrodes painted on:

1. Connect electrodes to a power supply, establishing a potential difference.
2. Use a voltmeter probe to locate points of equal potential.
3. Plot the equipotential lines by joining points of equal voltage.
4. Draw field lines perpendicular to the equipotentials.

:::caution Warning The field is zero on an equipotential. The field is non-zero and perpendicular;
only the component Tangent to the surface is zero.

## 5. Motion of Charged Particles in Uniform Fields

### Parabolic Trajectory

A particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ enters a uniform electric field $E$ with initial velocity $v$
Perpendicular to the field, between plates of length $L$.

**Horizontal** (perpendicular to field): uniform motion.

$$x = vt, \qquad t = \frac{L}{v}$$

**Vertical** (parallel to field): uniformly accelerated.

$$F = qE, \qquad a = \frac{qE}{m}$$

$$y = \frac{1}{2}at^2 = \frac{qEL^2}{2mv^2}$$

Eliminating $t$: $y = \frac{qE}{2mv^2}\,x^2$. This is a parabola.

**Vertical velocity at exit:** $v_y = at = \frac{qEL}{mv}$.

**Deflection angle:** $\tan\theta = \frac{v_y}{v} = \frac{qEL}{mv^2}$.

### Energy Method

An alternative approach uses energy conservation. The kinetic energy gained by the particle equals
the Work done by the field:

$$\Delta E_k = qV = qEd$$

Where $d$ is the vertical displacement. This is often quicker than the kinematic approach.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Electron Deflection</summary>
An electron enters a uniform field of $E = 5000$ V m$^{-1}$ between plates of length 5.0 cm with speed
$3.0 \times 10^7$ m s$^{-1}$. Calculate the vertical deflection and deflection angle.

**Answer.**
$a = \frac{eE}{m_e} = \frac◆LB◆1.60 \times 10^{-19} \times 5000◆RB◆◆LB◆9.11 \times 10^{-31}◆RB◆ = 8.78 \times 10^{14}$
m s$^{-2}$.

$t = L/v = 0.050 / (3.0 \times 10^7) = 1.67 \times 10^{-9}$ s.

$y = \frac{1}{2}at^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8.78 \times 10^{14} \times (1.67 \times 10^{-9})^2 = 1.22 \times 10^{-3}$
m $= 1.22$ mm.

$v_y = at = 8.78 \times 10^{14} \times 1.67 \times 10^{-9} = 1.47 \times 10^6$ m s$^{-1}$.

$\tan\theta = v_y/v = 1.47 \times 10^6 / (3.0 \times 10^7) = 0.0489$. $\theta = 2.80^\circ$.

</details>

## 6. Deflection of Electrons

### Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)

A CRT uses electric fields to control and deflect a beam of electrons:

1. **Electron gun:** A heated cathode emits electrons by thermionic emission. A high potential
   difference $V_{\mathrm{acc}}$ accelerates them through a potential difference, giving kinetic
   energy $\frac{1}{2}m_e v^2 = eV_{\mathrm{acc}}$.
2. **Deflection system:** Two pairs of parallel plates (X and Y) apply transverse electric fields,
   deflecting the beam horizontally and vertically.
3. **Fluorescent screen:** Electrons strike a phosphor coating, producing visible light.

### Acceleration Voltage and Beam Speed

From energy conservation:

$$\frac{1}{2}m_e v^2 = eV_{\mathrm{acc}}$$

$$\boxed{v = \sqrt◆LB◆\frac{2eV_{\mathrm{acc}}}{m_e}◆RB◆}$$

For $V_{\mathrm{acc}} = 2000$ V:
$v = \sqrt◆LB◆2 \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \times 2000 / 9.11 \times 10^{-31}◆RB◆ = 2.65 \times 10^7$
m s$^{-1}$.

### Sensitivity of a CRT

The deflection sensitivity $S$ is the deflection per unit deflection voltage:

$$S = \frac{y}{V_d} = \frac{eL^2}{2m_e v^2 d} = \frac◆LB◆L^2◆RB◆◆LB◆4V_{\mathrm{acc}}\,d◆RB◆$$

Where $L$ is the plate length and $d$ is the plate separation. Higher sensitivity requires longer
Plates, closer spacing, and lower acceleration voltage.

:::caution Common Pitfall A common error is to confuse the acceleration voltage $V_{\mathrm{acc}}$
(which determines beam speed) with the deflection voltage $V_d$ (which determines deflection). The
Deflection is proportional to $V_d$ and inversely proportional to $V_{\mathrm{acc}}$.
:::

## 7. Electric Fields of Extended Charge Distributions

### Field on the Axis of a Charged Ring

A ring of radius $a$ carrying total charge $Q$. The field at distance $x$ from the centre along the
Axis:

$$\boxed{E = \frac◆LB◆Qx◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0(x^2 + a^2)^{3/2}◆RB◆}$$

**Proof.** By symmetry, the transverse components cancel. Each element $dq$ contributes
$dE = dq/(4\pi\varepsilon_0(x^2 + a^2))$. The axial component is
$dE_x = dE \cdot x/\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}$. Integrating over the ring:

$$E_x = \frac◆LB◆Q◆RB◆◆LB◆4\pi\varepsilon_0◆RB◆\cdot\frac{x}{(x^2 + a^2)^{3/2}}$$

$\square$

**Checks.** At $x = 0$: $E = 0$ (by symmetry). For $x \gg a$: $E \approx Q/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 x^2)$
(point charge limit). $\checkmark$

### Field of an Infinite Line of Charge

For a line of charge with linear charge density $\lambda$ (C m$^{-1}$):

$$\boxed{E = \frac◆LB◆\lambda◆RB◆◆LB◆2\pi\varepsilon_0 r◆RB◆}$$

Where $r$ is the perpendicular distance from the line. Note: the field falls off as $1/r$Not $1/r^2$
Because a line charge is an extended source in one dimension.

## 8. Potential Gradient and the Millikan Experiment

### Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment

Millikan (1909--1913) measured the elementary charge $e$ by observing electrically charged oil drops
In a uniform electric field.

**Method:** An oil drop of mass $m$ carries charge $q$. In a uniform upward field $E$The drop is
Suspended when the electric force balances gravity:

$$qE = mg$$

$$\boxed{q = \frac{mg}{E}}$$

The mass is found from the terminal velocity (using Stokes' law for the drag force in air). Millikan
Found that all measured charges were integer multiples of $e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C.

**Significance.** This experiment proved that charge is quantised — it comes in discrete packets of
Size $e$.

## 9. Capacitance and Stored Energy

For a parallel-plate capacitor with plate area $A$ and separation $d$:

$$C = \frac◆LB◆\varepsilon_0 A◆RB◆◆LB◆d◆RB◆$$

The energy stored when the capacitor carries charge $Q$ at potential difference $V$:

$$\boxed{U = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2C}}$$

**Proof.** During charging, the p.d. At any instant is $v = q/C$. Work to transfer charge $dq$:
$dW = v\,dq = q\,dq/C$.

$$W = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C}\,dq = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$$

$\square$

The energy is stored in the electric field between the plates. The energy density is:

$$u = \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0 E^2$$

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing EMF and potential difference. EMF is the total energy per unit charge supplied; PD is
   the energy per unit charge transferred to a component.

2. Forgetting that ammeters are connected in series and voltmeters in parallel.

3. Incorrectly applying Kirchhoff's second law by missing components in a loop.

4. Confusing scalar and vector quantities. Always check whether direction matters for the quantity
   in question.

5. Misidentifying the system boundary when applying conservation laws. Define what is included
   before writing equations.

6. Forgetting to include units in final answers, especially when working with derived units like
   $\text{N}\,\text{kg}^{-1}\,\text{m}^2$.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Electric Field Between Parallel Plates

**Problem.** Two parallel plates are separated by $5\ \mathrm{cm}$ and have a potential difference
of $2000\ \mathrm{V}$ across them. Find the electric field strength and the force on an electron
between the plates.

**Solution.** $$E = \frac{V}{d} = \frac{2000}{0.05} = 40000\ \mathrm{V\,m^{-1}}$$

Force on the electron:

$$F = eE = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 40000 = 6.4 \times 10^{-15}\ \mathrm{N}$$

$\blacksquare$

### Example 2: Coulomb's Law for Two Charges

**Problem.** Two point charges $+3\ \mathrm{nC}$ and $-5\ \mathrm{nC}$ are separated by
$10\ \mathrm{cm}$ in vacuum. Calculate the electrostatic force between them.

**Solution.**
$$F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} = \frac{8.99 \times 10^9 \times 3 \times 10^{-9} \times 5 \times 10^{-9}}{(0.1)^2}$$

$$F = \frac{8.99 \times 10^9 \times 15 \times 10^{-18}}{0.01} = \frac{134.85 \times 10^{-9}}{0.01} = 1.35 \times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{N}$$

The force is attractive (opposite charges).

$\blacksquare$

## Summary

- Coulomb's law: $F = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$; like charges repel, unlike attract.
- Electric field strength: $E = \frac{F}{q}$; for a point charge
  $E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$.
- Uniform field between parallel plates: $E = \frac{V}{d}$; equipotential lines are perpendicular to
  field lines.
- Electric potential: $V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}$; potential energy: $W = qV$.
- $E = -\frac{dV}{dr}$; the electric field is the negative gradient of the potential.
