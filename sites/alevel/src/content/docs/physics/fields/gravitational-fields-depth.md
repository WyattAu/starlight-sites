## 1. Newton"s Law of Universal Gravitation

**Newton's Law.** Every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force directed along the
line Joining them, whose magnitude is:

$$\boxed{F = \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2}}$$

Where $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}$ N m$^2$ kg$^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant.

### Geometric Origin of the Inverse Square Law

Consider a point mass emitting gravitational flux uniformly in all directions. The flux through a
Sphere of radius $r$ is constant (by Gauss's law for gravity):

$$\oint \mathbf{g} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = -4\pi G M_{\mathrm{enc}}$$

Since the surface area is $4\pi r^2$The flux density (field strength) must be $g = GM/r^2$. The
Force on a test mass $m$ is then $F = mg = GMm/r^2$. This inverse square law is a direct geometric
Consequence of flux conservation in three-dimensional space.

### Properties of the Gravitational Force

- Always **attractive** (no negative mass exists).
- Infinite range — the force extends to arbitrarily large distances, weakening as $1/r^2$.
- Acts on all objects with mass — it is the universal force binding large-scale structures.
- Extremely weak compared to electromagnetism: $F_e/F_g \sim 10^{36}$ for elementary particles.

The weakness of gravity means it is only dominant at macroscopic scales where the near-perfect
Cancellation of positive and negative electric charges renders electromagnetic forces negligible.

## 2. Gravitational Field Strength

**Definition.** The gravitational field strength $\mathbf{g}$ at a point is the force per unit mass
on a Small test mass placed at that point:

$$\boxed{\mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m}}$$

SI units: N kg$^{-1}$Equivalent to m s$^{-2}$.

For a point mass $M$ at distance $r$:

$$\boxed{g = \frac{GM}{r^2}}$$

Directed radially inward towards $M$.

**Proof.** From Newton's law: $F = GMm/r^2$. Dividing by $m$: $g = F/m = GM/r^2$. $\square$

### Proof of the Shell Theorem

**Theorem.** A uniform spherical shell of mass $M$ and radius $R$ produces: (a) the same field as a
Point mass $M$ at its centre for all external points ($r \gt R$), and (b) zero field at all internal
Points ($r \lt R$).

**Proof (external, $r \gt R$).** Consider a test mass $m$ at distance $r$ from the centre. Divide
the Shell into thin annular rings perpendicular to the line from the centre to $m$. A ring at polar
angle $\theta$ has radius $R\sin\theta$Width $R\,d\theta$ And mass:

$$dM = \frac{M}{4\pi R^2} \cdot 2\pi R^2 \sin\theta\,d\theta = \frac{M}{2}\sin\theta\,d\theta$$

Every element of the ring is at distance $s = \sqrt{r^2 + R^2 - 2rR\cos\theta}$ from $m$. By
the Axial symmetry of the ring, the transverse components of force cancel, leaving only the
component Along the axis. The angle $\alpha$ between the force direction and the axis satisfies:

$$\cos\alpha = \frac{r - R\cos\theta}{s}$$

The axial force contribution from the ring is:

$$dF = \frac{Gm\,dM}{s^2}\cos\alpha = \frac{GmM}{2}\cdot\frac{(r - R\cos\theta)\sin\theta\,d\theta}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2rR\cos\theta)^{3/2}}$$

Substitute $u = \cos\theta$$du = -\sin\theta\,d\theta$. When $\theta = 0$$u = 1$; when
$\theta = \pi$$u = -1$:

$$F = \frac{GmM}{2}\int_{1}^{-1}\frac{(r - Ru)(-du)}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2rRu)^{3/2}}$$

The integral evaluates to
$\frac{2r}{r^2 - R^2} \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \cdot (r^2 - R^2) \cdot \frac{1}{r}$ After careful
algebra, giving:

$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

This is identical to the field of a point mass $M$ at the centre. $\square$

**Proof (internal, $r \lt R$).** The same integral with $r \lt R$ evaluates to zero. Physically, for
Every mass element pulling the test mass in one direction, there is a compensating element on the
Opposite side. The nearer element pulls more strongly (shorter distance) but is subtended by a
smaller Solid angle, and these two effects cancel exactly. $\square$

varies slightly with Latitude even at sea level.

### Field Strength at Altitude

At height $h$ above a planet of radius $R$ and surface field $g_0$:

$$\boxed{g = g_0\left(\frac{R}{R + h}\right)^2}$$

For $h \ll R$The binomial approximation gives $g \approx g_0(1 - 2h/R)$.

## 3. Gravitational Potential

**Definition.** The gravitational potential $V$ at a point is the work done per unit mass in
bringing a Small test mass from infinity to that point:

$$\boxed{V = -\frac{GM}{r}}$$

SI units: J kg$^{-1}$.

### Derivation

$$V = \frac{W}{m} = \frac{1}{m}\int_{\infty}^{r} \frac{GMm}{r'^2}\,dr' = GM\int_{\infty}^{r}\frac{dr'}{r'^2} = GM\left[-\frac{1}{r'}\right]_{\infty}^{r} = -\frac{GM}{r}$$

$\square$

**Why negative?** We define $V = 0$ at infinity. As the test mass moves inward, gravity does
positive Work, so the potential decreases. The potential at any finite $r$ is therefore negative,
becoming more Negative as $r$ decreases. An external agent must supply energy $GMm/r$ to move the
mass from $r$ back To infinity.

### Field--Potential Relationship

$$\boxed{g = -\frac{dV}{dr}}$$

**Proof.** $V = -GM/r = -GM r^{-1}$. Then:

$$\frac{dV}{dr} = GM\,r^{-2} = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$

The field (directed inward, i.e. In the negative radial direction) is:

$$g_r = -\frac{GM}{r^2} = -\frac{dV}{dr}$$

$\square$

The minus sign confirms that the field points in the direction of decreasing potential.

### Gravitational Potential Energy

For two masses $M$ and $m$ separated by $r$:

$$\boxed{E_p = -\frac{GMm}{r}}$$

**Connection to $E_p = mgh$.** For height $h \ll R_E$The Taylor expansion gives:

$$\Delta E_p = -\frac{GMm}{R_E + h} + \frac{GMm}{R_E} = \frac{GMmh}{R_E(R_E + h)} \approx \frac{GMmh}{R_E^2} = mgh$$

Since $g = GM/R_E^2$. The linear formula $mgh$ is the first-order approximation of the full
Gravitational potential energy.

## 4. Escape Velocity

**Definition.** The escape velocity $v_e$ is the minimum launch speed for an object to reach
infinity With zero residual speed from the surface of a body of mass $M$ and radius $R$.

### Derivation from Energy Conservation

At launch: $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv_e^2$$E_p = -GMm/R$. At infinity: $E_k = 0$$E_p = 0$. By energy
Conservation:

$$\frac{1}{2}mv_e^2 - \frac{GMm}{R} = 0$$

$$\boxed{v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}}$$

$\square$

### Relationship to Orbital Speed

The circular orbital speed at radius $r$ is $v_{\mathrm{orb}} = \sqrt{GM/r}$. Therefore:

$$v_e = \sqrt{2}\,v_{\mathrm{orb}}$$

Escape requires exactly twice the kinetic energy of a circular orbit:
$\frac{1}{2}mv_e^2 = 2 \times
\frac{1}{2}mv_{\mathrm{orb}}^2$. A spacecraft in circular orbit needs a
speed increase of $(\sqrt{2} - 1) \times 100\% \approx 41.4\%$ to escape.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Escape from Mars</summary>
Calculate the escape velocity from Mars ($M = 6.42 \times 10^{23}$ kg, $R = 3.39 \times 10^6$ m).

**Answer.**
$v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 6.42 \times 10^{23}}{3.39 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{\frac{8.56 \times 10^{13}}{3.39 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{2.53 \times 10^7} = 5020$
m s$^{-1}$ $= 5.02$ km s$^{-1}$.

</details>

:::caution
Projectile. A 1 kg ball and a $10^6$ kg rocket both need the same speed. However, the required
kinetic Energy $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv_e^2$ scales with mass.

## 5. Orbital Mechanics

### Circular Orbit Equations

For a satellite of mass $m$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around mass $M$:

| Quantity                 | Expression                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Orbital speed            | $v = \sqrt{GM/r}$                |
| Orbital period           | $T = 2\pi\sqrt{r^3/(GM)}$        |
| Centripetal acceleration | $a = GM/r^2 = g$                 |
| Kinetic energy           | $E_k = GMm/(2r)$                 |
| Potential energy         | $E_p = -GMm/r$                   |
| Total energy             | $E_{\mathrm{total}} = -GMm/(2r)$ |

**Proof of energy relations.** From $\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$: $v^2 = GM/r$.

$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{2r}$. $E_p = -GMm/r$. Total: $E_k + E_p = -\frac{GMm}{2r}$.

Note: $E_k = \frac{1}{2}|E_p|$ and $E_{\mathrm{total}} = E_k$. This is the virial theorem for bound
Gravitational systems: $2E_k + E_p = 0$. $\square$

**Key insight.** The total energy is negative — the satellite is gravitationally bound. To move to a
Higher orbit, energy must be added (the orbit becomes less negative). The kinetic energy _decreases_
With increasing $r$ But the total energy _increases_ (potential energy increase dominates).

### The Vis-Viva Equation

For any Keplerian orbit (circular or elliptical) with semi-major axis $a$:

$$\boxed{v^2 = GM\left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}$$

Setting $a = r$ recovers the circular orbit result. For a parabolic escape trajectory
($a \to \infty$): $v^2 = 2GM/r$Giving the escape speed.

### Orbital Speed is Mass-Independent

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$

The satellite's mass $m$ cancels. This is the same reason that all objects fall at the same rate in
a Gravitational field (equivalence principle).

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Satellite Orbit Change</summary>
A 500 kg satellite is in a circular orbit of radius $7.0 \times 10^6$ m. Calculate the energy
Required to move it to a circular orbit of radius $1.4 \times 10^7$ m.

**Answer.** $GM = 3.98 \times 10^{14}$ N m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$.

$E_1 = -\frac{GMm}{2r_1} = -\frac{3.98 \times 10^{14} \times 500}{2 \times 7.0 \times 10^6} = -1.42 \times 10^{10}$
J.

$E_2 = -\frac{3.98 \times 10^{14} \times 500}{2 \times 1.4 \times 10^7} = -7.11 \times 10^9$
J.

$\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = -7.11 \times 10^9 - (-1.42 \times 10^{10}) = 7.1 \times 10^9$ J $= 7.1$ GJ.

</details>

## 6. Kepler's Laws

### First Law: Law of Ellipses

Every planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focus.

**Proof sketch.** Starting from $\mathbf{F} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ (central force), the
orbit Equation in polar coordinates is:

$$r = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e\cos\theta}$$

Where $a$ is the semi-major axis and $e$ is the eccentricity. For $E \lt 0$ (bound orbit), $e \lt 1$
And the orbit is an ellipse with the central mass at one focus. $\square$

### Second Law: Law of Equal Areas

A line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

**Proof.** The gravitational force is central ($\mathbf{F} \parallel \mathbf{r}$), so torque
$\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} = 0$. Angular momentum $L = mrv_\perp$ is
constant.

Area swept in time $dt$: $dA = \frac{1}{2}r \cdot v_\perp\,dt = \frac{L}{2m}\,dt$.

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{L}{2m} = \mathrm{const}$$

$\square$

The planet moves fastest at perihelion (closest approach) and slowest at aphelion (farthest point),
Consistent with conservation of angular momentum: small $r$ requires large $v_\perp$.

### Third Law: Law of Periods

$$\boxed{T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}\,a^3}$$

**Proof for circular orbits.** Equating gravitational and centripetal force:

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$

Since $T = 2\pi r/v$:

$$T = \frac{2\pi r}{\sqrt{GM/r}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$$

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{GM}$$

For elliptical orbits, replace $r$ with the semi-major axis $a$. $\square$

The proportionality constant $4\pi^2/(GM)$ depends only on the central body, not on the orbiting
Object. This is how Kepler determined the relative distances of the planets from the Sun using only
Their observed periods.

## 7. Geostationary Orbits

**Definition.** A geostationary orbit is a circular, prograde, equatorial orbit with period equal to
One sidereal day ($T = 86164$ s), causing the satellite to remain fixed above a point on the
equator.

### Derivation of Orbital Radius

$$r^3 = \frac{GMT^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{3.98 \times 10^{14} \times (86164)^2}{4\pi^2} = 7.54 \times 10^{22}$$

$$\boxed{r = 4.22 \times 10^7\ \mathrm{m} = 42\,200\ \mathrm{km}}$$

Altitude above Earth's surface: $h = 42200 - 6370 = 35\,830$ km.

### Orbital Speed

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = \frac{2\pi r}{T} = 3070\ \mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}$$

### Three Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

1. **Correct radius:** $r \approx 42\,200$ km (from Kepler's third law with $T = 86164$ s).
2. **Equatorial plane:** Any inclination causes the satellite to trace a figure-eight (anisotropic
   pattern) as seen from the ground.
3. **Prograde rotation:** The satellite must orbit west to east, matching Earth's rotation.

:::caution
circular. GPS satellites are Neither — they use medium Earth orbits at 20,200 km altitude with
12-hour periods.

### Applications

- **Communications:** Constant line of sight to a ground station, ideal for broadcast and relay.
- **Weather monitoring:** Continuous hemispheric observation (e.g., Meteosat, GOES).
- **Early warning:** Persistent surveillance of fixed geographical regions.

## 8. Comparison with Electric Fields

| Property             | Gravitational                | Electric                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Source property      | Mass $M$                     | Charge $Q$                                  |
| Force law            | $F = Gm_1m_2/r^2$            | $F = q_1q_2/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2)$        |
| Field strength       | $g = GM/r^2$                 | $E = Q/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2)$             |
| Potential            | $V = -GM/r$ (always $\lt 0$) | $V = Q/(4\pi\varepsilon_0 r)$ (sign of $Q$) |
| Attractive/repulsive | Always attractive            | Both possible                               |
| Screening            | Impossible                   | Possible (Faraday cage)                     |
| Relative strength    | $\sim 10^{-36}$              | $\sim 1$                                    |

Both fields obey inverse square force laws, possess $1/r$ potentials, and satisfy a Gauss's law. The
Structural parallel is exact, differing only in the source property (mass vs. Charge) and the
Existence of negative charge enabling screening and repulsion.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing gravitational field strength $g$ with gravitational potential $V_g$. One is force per
   unit mass, the other is energy per unit mass.

2. Forgetting that field lines point in the direction a positive test charge (or mass) would move.

3. Misidentifying the system boundary when applying conservation laws. Define what is included
   before writing equations.

4. Neglecting air resistance or assuming ideal conditions when the question specifies a real-world
   scenario.

5. Using the wrong equation from the data sheet. Take time to read the full equation, including
   conditions and variable definitions.

6. Rounding intermediate answers too early, which compounds errors in multi-step calculations.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Gravitational Field Strength at an Altitude

**Problem.** Calculate the gravitational field strength at $300\ \mathrm{km}$ above the Earth's
surface. (Earth mass $M = 5.97 \times 10^{24}\ \mathrm{kg}$, radius
$R = 6.37 \times 10^6\ \mathrm{m}$, $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\ \mathrm{N\,m^2\,kg^{-2}}$.)

**Solution.** Distance from centre:
$r = 6.37 \times 10^6 + 3 \times 10^5 = 6.67 \times 10^6\ \mathrm{m}$.

$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.97 \times 10^{24}}{(6.67 \times 10^6)^2} = \frac{3.982 \times 10^{14}}{4.449 \times 10^{13}} = 8.95\ \mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$$

This is about 91% of the surface value ($9.81\ \mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$).

$\blacksquare$

### Example 2: Escape Velocity

**Problem.** Derive and calculate the escape velocity from the surface of the Earth.

**Solution.** At the surface, total energy:
$E_k + E_p = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\mathrm{esc}}^2 - \frac{GMm}{R}$.

At infinity: $E_k = 0$ and $E_p = 0$, so total energy $= 0$.

$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{\mathrm{esc}}^2 = \frac{GMm}{R} \implies v_{\mathrm{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

$$v_{\mathrm{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.97 \times 10^{24}}{6.37 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{1.25 \times 10^8} \approx 11.2\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$$

$\blacksquare$

## Summary

- Newton's law of gravitation: $F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$; always attractive.
- Gravitational field strength: $g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$; at the surface
  $g \approx 9.81\ \mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$.
- Gravitational potential: $V = -\frac{GM}{r}$; work done to move mass $m$: $W = m\Delta V$.
- Escape velocity: $v_{\mathrm{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$; for Earth
  $\approx 11.2\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$.
- Orbital velocity: $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$; $g = -\frac{dV}{dr}$ links field and potential.

## Intuition

From Newton's apple to quantum particles, physics explains how the world works through measurable quantities and testable laws. Forces cause acceleration, energy transforms between forms but is never lost, and waves carry information across vast distances. These concepts form the foundation for engineering, astronomy, and our understanding of reality itself.
