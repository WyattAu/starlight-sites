## 1. Magnetic Flux Density

**Definition.** The magnetic flux density $B$ (also called the magnetic field strength in the
context Of force calculations) is defined by the force on a current-carrying conductor:

$$\boxed{B = \frac◆LB◆F◆RB◆◆LB◆IL\sin\theta◆RB◆}$$

Where $F$ is the force on a wire of length $L$ carrying current $I$ at angle $\theta$ to the field.

SI unit: tesla (T). $1\ \mathrm{T} = 1\ \mathrm{N\,A^{-1}\,m^{-1}}$.

**Direction of force:** Given by Fleming"s Left-Hand Rule:

- First finger: Field ($B$)
- Second finger: Current ($I$)
- Thumb: Force ($F$)

The force is maximum when the wire is perpendicular to the field ($\theta = 90^\circ$): $F = BIL$.
The force is zero when the wire is parallel ($\theta = 0^\circ$).

## 2. Force on a Moving Charge

A charge $q$ moving with velocity $v$ at angle $\theta$ to a magnetic field experiences:

$$\boxed{F = Bqv\sin\theta}$$

**Derivation from the wire force.** Current in a wire: $I = nqvA$ where $n$ is the number density of
Charge carriers, $q$ is the charge per carrier, $v$ is the drift velocity, and $A$ is the
Cross-sectional area. The number of carriers in length $L$ is $nAL$. The force is:

$$F = BIL\sin\theta = B(nqvA)L\sin\theta = (nAL) \cdot Bqv\sin\theta$$

For a single charge ($nAL = 1$): $F = Bqv\sin\theta$. $\square$

For a charge moving perpendicular to the field ($\theta = 90^\circ$):

$$\boxed{F = Bqv}$$

:::caution Common Pitfall The magnetic force is always perpendicular to both $\mathbf{v}$ and
$\mathbf{B}$. It does no work ($\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$), so a magnetic field alone cannot
Change the speed of a charged particle — only its direction.
:::

## 3. Circular Motion in a Magnetic Field

When a charged particle moves perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, the magnetic force provides
The centripetal acceleration:

$$Bqv = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Solving for the radius:

$$\boxed{r = \frac{mv}{Bq}}$$

### Proof of Frequency Independence

The period of revolution:

$$T = \frac◆LB◆2\pi r◆RB◆◆LB◆v◆RB◆ = \frac◆LB◆2\pi m◆RB◆◆LB◆Bq◆RB◆$$

This is **independent of $v$ and $r$**. A faster particle traces a proportionally larger circle in
the Same time. The cyclotron frequency is:

$$f = \frac◆LB◆Bq◆RB◆◆LB◆2\pi m◆RB◆$$

**Physical reason.** The magnetic force is $F = Bqv = mv^2/r$Giving $r = mv/(Bq)$. Both $r$ and $v$
Increase proportionally, so $T = 2\pi r/v = 2\pi m/(Bq)$ is constant. This is the operating
principle Of the cyclotron accelerator.

### Kinetic Energy in Terms of Radius

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{B^2 q^2 r^2}{2m}$$

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Proton and Alpha Particle</summary>
A proton and an alpha particle enter a magnetic field with the same speed. The alpha particle has
Charge $+2e$ and mass $4m_p$. Compare their radii of curvature.

**Answer.** $r = mv/(Bq)$.

$r_\alpha / r_p = \frac◆LB◆(4m_p)v/(B \cdot 2e)◆RB◆◆LB◆m_p v/(Be)◆RB◆ = \frac{4}{2} = 2$.

The alpha particle has twice the radius. Despite having four times the mass, its double charge
reduces The ratio to 2:1.

</details>

## 4. Helical Motion

When a particle enters a uniform $\mathbf{B}$ field at angle $\theta$ to the field lines:

$$v_\perp = v\sin\theta, \qquad v_\parallel = v\cos\theta$$

The perpendicular component produces circular motion (radius $r = mv_\perp/(Bq)$Period
$T = 2\pi m/(Bq)$), while the parallel component is unaffected by the magnetic force (since
$\mathbf{F} \perp \mathbf{B}$There is no force component along $\mathbf{B}$).

The particle traces a **helix** with pitch:

$$\boxed{\mathrm{pitch} = v_\parallel\, T = \frac◆LB◆2\pi m v\cos\theta◆RB◆◆LB◆Bq◆RB◆}$$

## 5. Velocity Selector

Crossed electric and magnetic fields select particles of a specific velocity.

A particle with charge $q$ and velocity $v$ passes through a region where $\mathbf{E}$ and
$\mathbf{B}$ Are perpendicular. The electric force $F_E = qE$ acts in one direction; the magnetic
force $F_B = Bqv$ acts in the opposite direction.

For undeflected passage:

$$\boxed{qE = Bqv \implies v = \frac{E}{B}}$$

Only particles with this exact velocity pass through. Faster particles are deflected by the dominant
Magnetic force; slower particles by the electric force.

## 6. Electromagnetic Induction

### Magnetic Flux

$$\boxed{\Phi = BA\cos\theta}$$

Where $A$ is the area and $\theta$ is the angle between the field and the normal to the area.

SI unit: weber (Wb). $1\ \mathrm{Wb} = 1\ \mathrm{T\,m^2}$.

### Faraday's Law

**Statement.** The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. Equals the rate of change of flux linkage:

$$\boxed{|\varepsilon| = N\left|\frac◆LB◆d\Phi◆RB◆◆LB◆dt◆RB◆\right|}$$

Where $N$ is the number of turns and $N\Phi$ is the flux linkage.

### Lenz's Law

**Statement.** The direction of the induced current is such that it **opposes the change** in
magnetic Flux that produced it.

Lenz's law is the physical content of the minus sign in the full Faraday equation:

$$\varepsilon = -N\frac◆LB◆d\Phi◆RB◆◆LB◆dt◆RB◆$$

**Energy conservation argument.** If the induced current reinforced the flux change rather than
Opposing it, a self-amplifying cycle would create energy from nothing. The opposition ensures that
Work must be done to maintain the flux change, and this work appears as electrical energy.

:::tip Tip Determine the field direction that would oppose this change, (3) use the right-hand grip
rule to find The induced current direction.
:::

### Motional e.m.f.

A conducting rod of length $l$ moving at velocity $v$ perpendicular to a uniform field $B$:

$$\boxed{\varepsilon = Blv}$$

**Proof.** In time $dt$The rod sweeps area $l \cdot v\,dt$. Flux swept: $d\Phi = Blv\,dt$. By
Faraday's law: $\varepsilon = d\Phi/dt = Blv$. $\square$

**Alternative derivation.** Charges in the rod experience force $F = Bqv$ (by the magnetic force
law). This separates charges, creating an electric field $E = Blv/l = Bv$ inside the rod, giving
$\varepsilon = Bvl$.

## 7. The AC Generator

A coil of $N$ turns, area $A$Rotating at angular frequency $\omega$ in uniform field $B$:

$$\Phi = NBA\cos(\omega t)$$

$$\varepsilon = -\frac◆LB◆d\Phi◆RB◆◆LB◆dt◆RB◆ = NBA\omega\sin(\omega t)$$

$$\boxed{\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0\sin(\omega t)}$$

Where the peak e.m.f. Is $\varepsilon_0 = NBA\omega$.

The output is sinusoidal with the same frequency as the rotation. The peak e.m.f. Is proportional to
$N$, $B$, $A$And $\omega$.

## 8. Transformers

A transformer consists of a primary coil and a secondary coil wound on a shared iron core.

### Ideal Transformer Equations

$$\boxed{\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}}$$

**Proof.** The same changing flux $\Phi$ threads both coils. By Faraday's law: $V_p = N_p|d\Phi/dt|$
and $V_s = N_s|d\Phi/dt|$. Dividing gives the result. $\square$

For an ideal transformer (no energy losses), power is conserved:

$$V_p I_p = V_s I_s$$

$$\frac{I_s}{I_p} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$$

A step-up transformer ($N_s \gt N_p$) increases voltage but decreases current. A step-down
transformer ($N_s \lt N_p$) decreases voltage but increases current.

### Energy Losses in Real Transformers

| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Eddy currents              | Changing flux induces currents in the core     | Laminated core (thin insulated sheets) |
| Hysteresis                 | Repeated magnetisation/demagnetisation of core | Soft iron core (low coercivity)        |
| Resistive ($I^2R$) heating | Current in windings                            | Thick copper wire                      |
| Flux leakage               | Not all flux links both coils                  | Efficient core geometry                |

### Transformer Efficiency

$$\eta = \frac{V_s I_s}{V_p I_p} \times 100\%$$

Modern transformers achieve efficiencies exceeding 95% for power distribution applications.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Step-Down Transformer</summary>
A transformer with 2400 turns on the primary and 120 turns on the secondary is connected to 240 V AC.
The secondary delivers 8.0 A to a load. Assuming ideal behaviour, find the secondary voltage and
Primary current.

**Answer.** $V_s = V_p \times N_s/N_p = 240 \times 120/2400 = 12$ V.

$I_p = I_s \times N_s/N_p = 8.0 \times 120/2400 = 0.40$ A.

Check: $V_p I_p = 240 \times 0.40 = 96$ W. $V_s I_s = 12 \times 8.0 = 96$ W. $\checkmark$

</details>

## 9. Self-Inductance

When the current in a coil changes, the changing flux through the coil itself induces an e.m.f.:

$$\boxed{\varepsilon = -L\frac{dI}{dt}}$$

Where $L$ is the self-inductance in henry (H).
$1\ \mathrm{H} = 1\ \mathrm{Wb\,A^{-1}} = 1\ \mathrm{V\,s\,A^{-1}}$.

### Energy Stored in an Inductor

$$\boxed{E = \frac{1}{2}LI^2}$$

**Proof.** Power delivered to inductor while current grows from 0 to $I$:

$$P = -\varepsilon I = LI\frac{dI}{dt}$$

$$E = \int_0^t P\,dt' = \int_0^I LI'\,dI' = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$

$\square$

This is the magnetic analogue of $\frac{1}{2}CV^2$ for capacitors. The energy is stored in the
Magnetic field, with energy density $u = B^2/(2\mu_0)$.

## 10. Force Between Parallel Current-Carrying Wires

### Derivation

Wire 1 (current $I_1$) creates field at distance $d$: $B_1 = \mu_0 I_1/(2\pi d)$.

Wire 2 (current $I_2$Length $L$) in this field experiences force:

$$F = B_1 I_2 L = \frac◆LB◆\mu_0 I_1 I_2 L◆RB◆◆LB◆2\pi d◆RB◆$$

$$\boxed{\frac{F}{L} = \frac◆LB◆\mu_0 I_1 I_2◆RB◆◆LB◆2\pi d◆RB◆}$$

### Direction

- Same-direction currents: attractive
- Opposite-direction currents: repulsive

This can be determined by applying the right-hand grip rule to wire 1 (to find $\mathbf{B}_1$ at
wire 2) and Fleming's left-hand rule to wire 2 (to find the force direction).

The ampere is defined such that two parallel wires 1 m apart, each carrying 1 A, experience a force
of Exactly $2 \times 10^{-7}$ N m$^{-1}$.

<summary>Problem 7</summary>
State Lenz's law and explain why it is a consequence of energy conservation.

**Answer.** Lenz's law: the induced current flows in a direction such that its magnetic effect
opposes The change in flux that produced it.

If the induced current reinforced the flux change, the increased flux would induce more current,
Creating a positive feedback loop. This would generate electrical energy from nothing, violating
Conservation of energy. The opposition ensures work must be done against the induced effects, and
this Work is converted to electrical energy.

<summary>Problem 12</summary>
Explain why eddy currents in a transformer core reduce efficiency, and describe how lamination
Mitigates this.

**Answer.** The alternating magnetic flux induces circulating currents (eddy currents) in the
Conductive iron core by Faraday's law. These currents dissipate energy as heat via $P = I^2R$
Reducing the useful power delivered to the secondary.

Lamination divides the core into thin, electrically insulated sheets perpendicular to the eddy
Current paths. This increases the effective resistance of each current loop, reducing the magnitude
Of the eddy currents and thus the power dissipated.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing gravitational field strength $g$ with gravitational potential $V_g$ — one is force per
   unit mass, the other is energy per unit mass.

2. Forgetting that field lines point in the direction a positive test charge (or mass) would move.

3. Confusing displacement with distance, or velocity with speed, particularly in graphs and
   calculations.

4. Rounding intermediate answers too early, which compounds errors in multi-step calculations.

5. Confusing scalar and vector quantities — always check whether direction matters for the quantity
   in question.

6. Neglecting air resistance or assuming ideal conditions when the question specifies a real-world
   scenario.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Force on a Current-Carrying Wire

**Problem.** A straight wire of length $0.3\ \mathrm{m}$ carries a current of $5\ \mathrm{A}$ at
right angles to a uniform magnetic field of flux density $0.4\ \mathrm{T}$. Calculate the force on
the wire.

**Solution.** $$F = BIl = 0.4 \times 5 \times 0.3 = 0.6\ \mathrm{N}$$

Direction: by Fleming's left-hand rule, the force is perpendicular to both the field and current.

$\blacksquare$

### Example 2: Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field

**Problem.** An electron with speed $2 \times 10^6\ \mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ enters a uniform magnetic
field of $0.05\ \mathrm{T}$ perpendicular to its velocity. Calculate the radius of its circular
path. ($m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31}\ \mathrm{kg}$, $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}$.)

**Solution.** The magnetic force provides the centripetal force:

$$Bev = \frac{mv^2}{r} \implies r = \frac{mv}{Be}$$

$$r = \frac{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 2 \times 10^6}{0.05 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1.822 \times 10^{-24}}{8 \times 10^{-21}} = 2.28 \times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{m} = 0.228\ \mathrm{mm}$$

$\blacksquare$
