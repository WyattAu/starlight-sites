    question: 'Which of the following is always true for an exothermic reaction?',
    options: [
      'A) The products have higher enthalpy than the reactants',
      'B) Enthalpy change (delta H) is negative and heat is released to the surroundings',
      'C) Activation energy is zero',
      'D) The reaction is always spontaneous',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      'In an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy of the products is LOWER than the reactants. Delta H is negative (heat released to surroundings). Activation energy is always non-zero (except for some radical reactions). Spontaneity depends on Gibbs free energy (delta G = delta H - T delta S), not just enthalpy. An exothermic reaction can be non-spontaneous if delta S is sufficiently negative.',

    explanation:
      "By\nHess’s Law: Route 1 (direct): C(s) + 0.5 O2(g) -> CO(g), delta H = ?. Route 2 (indirect): C(s) + O2(g) -> CO2(g) is -393, then reverse CO oxidation: CO2(g) -> CO(g) + 0.5 O2(g) is +283.

    explanation:
      'The standard enthalpy of atomisation of chlorine is\ndefined as the enthalpy change to produce 1 mole of gaseous Cl atoms from Cl2(g). This is +122 kJ\nmol-1 per mole of Cl atoms. Since Cl2(g) -> 2Cl(g) produces 2 moles of Cl atoms, the total enthalpy\nchange for breaking one mole of Cl-Cl bonds = 2 x 122 = +244 kJ mol-1. The mean bond enthalpy of\nCl-Cl = +244 kJ mol-1.

    explanation:
      'A heterogeneous catalyst is in a\ndifferent phase to the reactants (usually solid catalysing gaseous/liquid reactants).

    correct: 3,
    explanation:
      "Applying Le Chatelier’s principle: increasing temperature adds heat (a 'product' for exothermic reactions). The system shifts LEFT to absorb the added heat, favouring the endothermic (reverse) direction. Decreasing temperature would shift RIGHT. Increasing pressure favours the side with fewer moles of gas (right, 2 mol vs 4 mol). A catalyst increases the rate of BOTH forward and reverse reactions equally, having NO effect on equilibrium position.",

    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      'Adding an inert gas at constant pressure increases the total volume of the system (since the container must expand to maintain constant pressure). However, the partial pressures (and therefore concentrations) of all reactants and products remain unchanged because the inert gas does not react. Since Qp = Kp initially and neither changes, there is NO shift in equilibrium position. Kp is constant at a given temperature and is not affected by adding inert gas. Note: at constant VOLUME, adding inert gas increases total pressure but partial pressures stay the same -- again no shift.',

      'An acidic buffer consists of a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A-, from a soluble salt). When H+ is added: A- + H+ -> HA. The conjugate base mops up the added H+, converting it to the weak acid. The ratio [HA]/[A-] changes slightly but pH changes only minimally (governed by Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])). Adding strong base has the reverse effect: HA + OH- -> A- + H2O.
