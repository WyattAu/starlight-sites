      'AD = C + I + G + (X - M), where C = consumption, I = investment, G = government spending, and (X - M) = net exports. Interest rates are NOT a component of AD; however, they are a factor that INFLUENCES AD (higher interest rates reduce C and I by increasing the cost of borrowing and encouraging saving).

    explanation:

For example, if MPC rises from 0.6 to 0.8, the multiplier increases from 2.5 to 5. This means any initial injection (e.g. government spending) will have a larger final impact on AD and national income. The multiplier effect was central to Keynesian economics.',

    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      'Crowding out occurs when government borrowing (to finance a budget deficit) increases demand for loanable funds, pushing up interest rates. Higher interest rates then discourage private investment (I falls), partially offsetting the expansionary effect of increased G. Full crowding out means the increase in G is exactly offset by the decrease in I. This is a key critique of fiscal policy by neoclassical economists (contrast with Keynes, who argued crowding out is minimal during a recession when interest rates are already low).',

    options: [
      'A) Fiscal policy is equally effective at all points in the economic cycle',
      'B) During a recession there is spare capacity, so increased AD is less likely to cause inflation and crowding out is reduced',

    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      'Keynes argued that during a recession: (1) There is spare capacity (unemployed resources), so increased AD leads to higher output rather than inflation; (2) Crowding out is minimal because the economy is not at full employment; (3) Interest rates are already low, so government borrowing has less impact on rates. During a boom, the economy is near full capacity -- increased AD would primarily cause inflation. This supports the Keynesian view that fiscal policy should be counter-cyclical. Friedman and monetarists argue fiscal policy is less effective overall due to Ricardian equivalence and government inefficiency.',
