    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'In an independent groups design, participants are allocated to separate groups, each experiencing only one condition. This eliminates order effects but requires a larger sample and risks individual differences confounding results. Repeated measures uses the same participants in all conditions, and matched pairs pairs participants on key variables.',

    explanation:
      'Stratified sampling divides the population into relevant subgroups (strata) such as age or gender, then randomly selects a proportional number from each stratum. This preserves the population structure in the sample. Random sampling gives equal chance to all; opportunity sampling uses convenience; snowball sampling relies on referrals.',

      'Counterbalancing controls for order effects (practice effects and fatigue effects) by varying the order in which conditions are presented. Half the participants receive condition A then B; the other half receive B then A. This balances out any advantage or disadvantage from order, making it easier to attribute differences between conditions to the independent variable rather than order.',

    explanation:
      'Asch found that 75% of participants conformed on at least one trial, even though the correct answer was unambiguous. Overall conformity rate was 37% across all critical trials.

In Milgram’s study, participants entered the agentic state, believing the experimenter was responsible for the learner's welfare. Factors facilitating this include perceived legitimacy of the authority and the institutional setting.",

      'The augmentation principle (Nemeth) states that when a minority takes risks or suffers for their cause (e.g., imprisonment, violence), their arguments gain credibility. Extreme actions draw attention and make the moderate demands of the minority seem more reasonable by comparison. This was illustrated by the civil rights movement, where activists facing arrest and brutality made demands for equal rights appear more justified.',

LTM has potentially unlimited capacity and duration.',

      "Bartlett found that Western participants distorted the Native American story 'War of the Ghosts' to fit their existing schemas. Ghosts and spiritual elements were rationalised or omitted; the narrative became more logical and conventional. This supports reconstructive memory theory: memory is not a passive recording but an active process where schemas fill in gaps and alter details. The story became shorter, more coherent, and more Western in tone with each recall.",

    explanation:
      "Insecure-avoidant infants (Type A, about 15% of Ainsworth’s sample) show little distress when the mother leaves, ignore her when she returns, and avoid physical contact. They often treat strangers similarly to the caregiver. Ainsworth linked this to caregivers who are rejecting or insensitive to the infant's needs. By contrast, securely attached infants (Type B) are distressed by separation and easily comforted on return.",

Key criticisms: (1) Social norms change over time (e.g., homosexuality was classified as a disorder until 1973); (2) norms differ between cultures (hearing voices is abnormal in Western cultures but valued in some African cultures); (3) some deviant behaviour is not a mental disorder (e.g., political protest).
