## Limits and Continuity — Diagnostic Tests

## Unit Tests

> Tests edge cases, boundary conditions, and common misconceptions for limits and continuity.

### UT-1: Epsilon-Delta Proof with a Non-Polynomial Function

**Question:**

Prove using an epsilon-delta argument that $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2} x^3 = 8$.

A student writes the following "proof":

> For any $\varepsilon > 0$Choose $\delta = \varepsilon / 12$. Then
> $|x^3 - 8| = |x - 2| \cdot |x^2 + 2x + 4|$. If $|x - 2| \lt \delta$Then
> $|x^3 - 8| \lt 12 \cdot \delta = \varepsilon$.

Identify the logical gap in this proof and provide a correct epsilon-delta proof.

**Solution:**

The student"s proof implicitly assumes $|x^2 + 2x + 4| \leq 12$ without justification. This must be
shown by first restricting $\delta$ to ensure $x$ is close enough to $2$ for this bound to hold.

**Correct proof:**

Let $\varepsilon > 0$. We need $|x^3 - 8| = |x - 2| \cdot |x^2 + 2x + 4| \lt \varepsilon$.

First, restrict $\delta \leq 1$ so that $|x - 2| \lt 1$Meaning $1 \lt x \lt 3$. On this interval:

$$x^2 + 2x + 4 \lt 9 + 6 + 4 = 19$$

Therefore $|x^2 + 2x + 4| \lt 19$ when $|x - 2| \lt 1$.

Now choose $\delta = \min\left(1, \dfrac{\varepsilon}{19}\right)$. If $|x - 2| \lt \delta$Then:

$$|x^3 - 8| = |x - 2| \cdot |x^2 + 2x + 4| \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{19} \cdot 19 = \varepsilon$$

The key misconception: students often pick $\delta$ as a simple function of $\varepsilon$ without
first bounding the non-linear factor. The two-step process (restrict $\delta$ to bound the
non-linear part, then relate $\delta$ to $\varepsilon$) is essential.

### UT-2: L'Hopital's Rule Applied to a Non-Indeterminate Form

**Question:**

A student attempts to evaluate $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x + \sin x}{x}$ by applying
L'Hopital's rule:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x + \sin x}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 + \cos x}{1} = 2$$

(a) Explain why this application of L'Hopital's rule is invalid. (b) Evaluate the limit correctly
using two different valid methods. (c) Explain why the student's answer happens to be correct
despite the invalid reasoning.

**Solution:**

(a) L'Hopital's rule requires the limit to be of the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$ or
$\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. Here:

$$\lim_{x \to 0}(x + \sin x) = 0 + 0 = 0 \quad \text{and \quad \lim_{x \to 0} x = 0$$

So the limit IS $\frac{0}{0}$ -- L'Hopital's rule is actually valid here. However, the student did
not verify the indeterminate form before applying it. Let us reconsider: the student's error is
failing to check the conditions. In this case, the conditions happen to be met, so the answer is
correct by coincidence.

**Revised question interpretation:** Suppose instead the student tries to evaluate
$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$ using L'Hopital's rule and writes:

$$\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{2x}{1} = 2$$

This IS valid ($\frac{0}{0}$ form). Now consider
$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x + \sin x}{x}$. A student applies L'Hopital's:

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1 + \cos x}{1}$$

This limit does not exist (oscillates between 0 and 2). The student concludes the original limit
DNE.

(b) Correct evaluation of $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x + \sin x}{x}$:

**Method 1 (Algebraic):**

$$\frac{x + \sin x}{x} = 1 + \frac{\sin x}{x}$$

Since $-1 \leq \sin x \leq 1$We have $|\sin x / x| \leq 1/|x| \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$. Therefore:

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x + \sin x}{x} = 1$$

**Method 2 (Squeeze theorem):** $-1/x \leq \sin x / x \leq 1/x$And both bounds $\to 0$So
$\sin x / x \to 0$.

(c) The original limit $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x + \sin x}{x}$: L'Hopital gives the
correct answer $2$ because the conditions ARE satisfied. The misconception to target is applying
L'Hopital when the limit of the ratio of derivatives does not exist, which does NOT imply the
original limit DNE.

### UT-3: Classifying Discontinuities and Continuity Conditions

**Question:**

Let $f$ be defined by:

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} \dfrac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 1} & \text{if  x \neq 1, -1 \\ 1 & \text{if  x = 1 \end{cases}$$

(a) Find $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 1} f(x)$. (b) Is $f$ continuous at $x = 1$? State all three
conditions for continuity at a point and verify each. (c) Classify the discontinuity at $x = 1$ if
one exists. (d) Classify the discontinuity at $x = -1$ and explain why it is a different type.

**Solution:**

(a) Factor the numerator and denominator:

$$\frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{(x-1)(x-3)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \frac{x-3}{x+1} \quad \text{for  x \neq 1$$

$$\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = \frac{1 - 3}{1 + 1} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1$$

(b) The three conditions for continuity at $x = a$:

1. $f(a)$ is defined: $f(1) = 1$. (Yes)
2. $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists: $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = -1$. (Yes)
3. $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$: $-1 \neq 1$. (**No**)

$f$ is NOT continuous at $x = 1$ because condition 3 fails.

(c) Since the limit exists but does not equal the function value, this is a **removable
discontinuity**. We could make $f$ continuous by redefining $f(1) = -1$.

(d) At $x = -1$:

$$\lim_{x \to -1} \frac{x-3}{x+1}$$

As $x \to -1^+$: $\frac{-4}{0^+} \to -\infty$. As $x \to -1^-$: $\frac{-4}{0^-} \to +\infty$.

The one-sided limits are both infinite but with opposite signs, so this is an **infinite
discontinuity** (the limit DNE). This differs from $x = 1$ because the limit itself does not exist
at $x = -1$Whereas at $x = 1$ the limit exists but does not match the function value.

## Integration Tests

### IT-1: Intermediate Value Theorem with Trigonometric Functions (with Derivatives)

**Question:**

Let $g(x) = x^3 + 2x - 5 + \cos(\pi x)$. Prove that $g(x) = 0$ has at least one solution in the
interval $(0, 2)$. Then determine whether the solution is unique using Rolle's theorem applied to
$g'(x)$.

**Solution:**

**Existence (IVT):** $g$ is continuous everywhere as a sum of continuous functions.

$$g(0) = 0 + 0 - 5 + \cos(0) = -5 + 1 = -4 \lt 0$$

$$g(2) = 8 + 4 - 5 + \cos(2\pi) = 7 + 1 = 8 \gt 0$$

Since $g(0) \lt 0 \lt g(2)$ and $g$ is continuous on $[0, 2]$By the IVT there exists $c \in (0, 2)$
such that $g(c) = 0$.

**Uniqueness (Rolle's theorem via monotonicity):**

$$g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 - \pi \sin(\pi x)$$

We need to show $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. Note that $-\pi \sin(\pi x) \geq -\pi$So:

$$g'(x) \geq 3x^2 + 2 - \pi$$

For $x \geq 0$: $3x^2 + 2 - \pi > 0$ when $3x^2 > \pi - 2$I.e.,
$x > \sqrt{(\pi - 2)/3} \approx 0.62$.

For $x \in [0, 0.62]$: $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 - \pi\sin(\pi x)$. Since $\sin(\pi x) \leq \pi x$ for
$x \geq 0$ (and $\pi x \leq \pi \cdot 0.62 \lt 2$), we have
$g'(x) \geq 3(0)^2 + 2 - \pi(1) = 2 - \pi \approx -1.14$Which is negative. A finer argument is
needed.

A cleaner argument: $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 - \pi\sin(\pi x)$. Since
$|\pi\sin(\pi x)| \leq \pi \approx 3.14$ and $3x^2 + 2 \geq 2$We have
$g'(x) \geq 2 - 3.14 = -1.14$Which does not prove positivity.

Let us check directly:
$g'(0) = 2$$g'(1) = 3 + 2 - 0 = 5$$g'(0.5) = 0.75 + 2 - \pi \approx 2.75 - 3.14 = -0.39$.

Since $g'$ changes sign, $g$ is not strictly increasing on all of $[0, 2]$So Rolle's theorem alone
cannot guarantee uniqueness on this interval. The IVT guarantees at least one root, but uniqueness
cannot be established without a more refined analysis. This is the key insight: the IVT guarantees
existence, but uniqueness requires additional structure.

### IT-2: Limits Defining Derivatives at Non-Smooth Points (with Derivatives)

**Question:**

Let $f(x) = |x^2 - 4|$. Determine whether $f$ is differentiable at $x = 2$ and $x = -2$ by
evaluating the appropriate limits. For each point where $f$ is not differentiable, classify the
discontinuity of $f'$.

**Solution:**

$f(x) = |x^2 - 4| = \begin{cases} x^2 - 4 & \text{if  |x| \geq 2 \\ 4 - x^2 & \text{if  |x| \lt 2 \end{cases}$

**At $x = 2$:**

Left-hand derivative:

$$f'_{-}(2) = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{(4 - (2+h)^2) - 0}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-4h - h^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-}(-4 - h) = -4$$

Right-hand derivative:

$$f'_{+}(2) = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{((2+h)^2 - 4) - 0}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{4h + h^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+}(4 + h) = 4$$

Since $f'_{-}(2) = -4 \neq 4 = f'_{+}(2)$, $f$ is **not differentiable** at $x = 2$.

**At $x = -2$:**

Left-hand derivative:

$$f'_{-}(-2) = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(-2+h) - f(-2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{((-2+h)^2 - 4) - 0}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-4h + h^2}{h} = -4$$

Right-hand derivative:

$$f'_{+}(-2) = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(-2+h) - f(-2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{(4 - (-2+h)^2) - 0}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{4h - h^2}{h} = 4$$

Since $-4 \neq 4$, $f$ is **not differentiable** at $x = -2$ either.

$f$ is continuous at both points ($f(2) = f(-2) = 0$ and the limits equal the function value),
confirming that continuity does not imply differentiability. The discontinuity of $f'$ at
$x = \pm 2$ is a **jump discontinuity** (finite jump from $-4$ to $4$).

### IT-3: Limit at Infinity with Parametric Complexity (with Integrals)

**Question:**

Let $F(x) = \displaystyle\int_0^x \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1 + t^2} \, dt$.

(a) Prove that $F(x)$ converges as $x \to \infty$ by showing the improper integral
$\displaystyle\int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1 + t^2} \, dt$ converges. (b) Find
$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} x \cdot F(x)$.

**Solution:**

(a) For $t \geq 0$: $0 \lt \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1 + t^2} \leq e^{-t^2}$.

Since $\displaystyle\int_0^{\infty} e^{-t^2} \, dt = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \lt \infty$ (Gaussian
integral), by the comparison test for improper integrals:

$$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1 + t^2} \, dt \leq \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t^2} \, dt = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \lt \infty$$

Therefore $F(x)$ converges to some finite limit
$L = \displaystyle\int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1 + t^2} \, dt$ as $x \to \infty$.

(b) Let $L = \displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x)$. Since $F(x) \to L \neq 0$We have
$x \cdot F(x) \to \infty$. A more interesting limit is obtained by considering the tail: let
$G(x) = L - F(x) = \displaystyle\int_x^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1+t^2}\,dt$And evaluate
$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} x \cdot G(x)$.

$$x \cdot G(x) = x \int_x^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1+t^2}\,dt$$

For large $x$The dominant contribution comes from $t$ near $x$. Substitute $u = t - x$:

$$G(x) \approx \int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-(x+u)^2}}{1+(x+u)^2}\,du \approx \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^2} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-2xu}\,du = \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^2} \cdot \frac{1}{2x}$$

So $x \cdot G(x) \approx \dfrac{e^{-x^2}}{2(1+x^2)} \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$.

More rigorously:
$0 \lt G(x) = \displaystyle\int_x^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{1+t^2}\,dt \lt e^{-x^2}\displaystyle\int_x^{\infty}\frac{dt}{1+t^2} = e^{-x^2}\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan x\right)$.
Since $\frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan x \sim \frac{1}{x}$ as $x \to \infty$:

$$0 \lt x \cdot G(x) \lt x \cdot e^{-x^2} \cdot \frac{C}{x} = Ce^{-x^2} \to 0$$

Therefore $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} x \cdot G(x) = 0$.

## Summary

The key principles covered in this topic are linked in the sub-pages above. Focus on understanding
the definitions, applying the formulas or frameworks, and evaluating strengths and limitations of
each approach.

## Worked Examples

Worked examples demonstrating the application of key concepts are covered in the detailed sub-pages
linked above.

## Intuition

Limit diagnostics test whether you understand the **rigorous foundations** of calculus — epsilon-delta proofs, the precise conditions for L'Hopital's rule, and the classification of discontinuities. These are the concepts that separate procedural fluency from genuine understanding.

**Epsilon-delta intuition:** The definition says: for any tolerance $\varepsilon$ around the limit value, you can find a neighbourhood $\delta$ around the point where all function values stay within $\varepsilon$. The key is that you must *bound* the non-linear parts of the expression before relating $\delta$ to $\varepsilon$ — you can't just pick $\delta = \varepsilon / (\text{something})$ without justification.

**L'Hopital's trap:** L'Hopital's rule only applies to indeterminate forms $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. If the limit of the ratio of derivatives doesn't exist, that does *not* mean the original limit doesn't exist — it means L'Hopital's rule failed, and you need another method (algebra, squeeze theorem, etc.).

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing terminology or concepts that appear similar but have distinct meanings.
- Overlooking key assumptions or boundary conditions that limit applicability.
