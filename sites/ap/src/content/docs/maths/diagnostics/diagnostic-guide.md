# AP Calculus Diagnostic Guide

## Purpose

Diagnostic tests are targeted assessments designed to probe the boundaries of your understanding.
Unlike practice exams that sample broadly, diagnostics focus on the specific misconceptions, edge
cases, and synthesis skills that separate students who can follow procedures from those who
understand the underlying mathematics.

Each diagnostic file contains two categories of tests:

- **Unit Tests (UT):** Test a single topic in isolation. They target common misconceptions, boundary
  conditions, and the "tricky" cases that AP exams favor in their harder multiple-choice and
  free-response questions.
- **Integration Tests (IT):** Require synthesizing two or more topics. These reflect the multi-step
  reasoning demanded by AP free-response questions, where a single problem might require a limit, a
  derivative, and an integral.

## How to Use

1. **Complete the prerequisite chain first.** Do not attempt a diagnostic until you have studied the
   topic thoroughly. Diagnostics test mastery, not initial exposure.
2. **Work each problem under timed conditions.** See the timing recommendations below.
3. **Grade using the rubric before reading the solution.** Mark each problem as PASS, PARTIAL, or
   FAIL (see rubric below).
4. **Read the full solution for every problem**, even those you passed. Solutions often contain
   insights about common misconceptions that may affect you in other contexts.
5. **Re-attempt failed problems after 24 hours.** If you fail the same problem twice, return to your
   notes and study the relevant concepts before trying again.
6. **Track results over time.** Use the self-assessment framework below to maintain a record of your
   progress.

## Grading Rubric

### PASS

- Correct final answer with valid reasoning.
- Minor arithmetic errors that do not affect the conceptual approach are acceptable.
- The solution demonstrates understanding of why the method works, not just how to execute it.

### PARTIAL

- Correct approach but incorrect execution (e.g., right test choice but wrong algebra).
- Correct answer but missing justification or explanation.
- Identified the key concept but could not complete the computation.
- Made the target misconception but partially recovered.

### FAIL

- Incorrect approach or method.
- Did not identify the relevant concept or test.
- Made the target misconception without recognition.
- Blank or fundamentally misdirected response.

## Building Your Test Matrix

Create a tracking table for each attempt:

| Test | Topic 1 | Topic 2 | Topic 3 | Topic 4 | Topic 5 |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| UT-1 | PASS    | PARTIAL | FAIL    |         |         |
| UT-2 |         |         |         |         |         |
| UT-3 |         |         |         |         |         |
| IT-1 |         |         |         |         |         |
| IT-2 |         |         |         |         |         |
| IT-3 |         |         |         |         |         |

A topic is **diagnostic-ready** when you score PASS on at least 2 of 3 unit tests and at least 1 of
3 integration tests.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests isolate a single concept and test it at the difficulty ceiling of the AP specification.
Each UT targets a specific misconception:

- **What it tests:** Whether you can recognize and avoid a known pitfall.
- **Why it matters:** AP exams consistently test the same misconceptions year after year. Mastering
  these patterns is high-leverage preparation.
- **How to study from failures:** Return to the relevant notes section. Re-read the conceptual
  explanation, then work 3-5 practice problems of increasing difficulty before re-attempting the
  diagnostic.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests require combining two or more topics within a single problem. They mirror the
structure of AP free-response questions, where multi-step reasoning is the norm.

- **What it tests:** Whether you can identify which tools to use and chain them correctly.
- **Why it matters:** Most AP free-response questions require synthesis. Being strong in isolation
  but weak in combination is a common gap.
- **How to study from failures:** Break the problem into its component skills. Identify which step
  caused the failure and study that specific skill before re-attempting the full synthesis.

## Timing Recommendations

| Test Type                    | Suggested Time | Notes                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Unit Test                    | 8-12 minutes   | Focus on correctness, not speed       |
| Integration Test             | 12-18 minutes  | Multi-step problems require more time |
| Full diagnostic (1 topic)    | 60-75 minutes  | All 6 tests with breaks               |
| Full diagnostic (all topics) | 5-6 hours      | Spread across multiple sessions       |

Do not rigidly enforce time limits during initial attempts. Speed comes with mastery. During later
attempts, tighten timing to build exam readiness.

## Self-Assessment Framework

### AP Prerequisite Chains

The AP Calculus curriculum has a natural dependency structure. Master each level before proceeding
to the next:

```
Limits and Continuity
        |
        v
   Derivatives
        |
        v
    Integrals
       / \
      v   v
  Diff Eq   Sequences/Series [BC Only]
```

**Chain 1 (Foundation):** Limits and Continuity must be mastered before Derivatives. The derivative
is defined as a limit, and differentiability depends on continuity.

**Chain 2 (Core):** Derivatives must be mastered before Integrals. The Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus connects the two, and integration techniques rely on differentiation skills.

**Chain 3a (Applications):** Integrals feed into Differential Equations. Separation of variables
requires integration, and slope fields require understanding of derivatives.

**Chain 3b (BC Extension):** Integrals feed into Sequences and Series. The integral test connects
series to improper integrals, and Taylor series require computing derivatives.

### AB vs BC Coverage Matrix

| Diagnostic             | AB Required | BC Required |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Limits and Continuity  | All UT + IT | All UT + IT |
| Derivatives            | All UT + IT | All UT + IT |
| Integrals              | All UT + IT | All UT + IT |
| Differential Equations | All UT + IT | All UT + IT |
| Sequences and Series   | Not tested  | All UT + IT |

**AB students:** Complete the first four diagnostics. The AB exam does not test sequences and
series.

**BC students:** Complete all five diagnostics. The BC exam covers all AB topics plus sequences and
series.

### Readiness Thresholds

**AB Exam Readiness:** PASS on at least 2/3 unit tests and 1/3 integration tests across all four AB
topics.

**BC Exam Readiness:** PASS on at least 2/3 unit tests and 1/3 integration tests across all five
topics.

**Distinction Readiness (score 4-5):** PASS on all unit tests and at least 2/3 integration tests
across all relevant topics.

## Intuition

Diagnostics are **stress tests** for your understanding. Unlike practice exams that sample broadly, diagnostics probe the specific edge cases, boundary conditions, and misconceptions that separate students who memorise procedures from those who understand the mathematics.

**Why diagnostics matter:** AP exams consistently test the same tricky cases year after year. If you can handle the diagnostic problems — where the "obvious" approach fails or requires careful reasoning — you can handle anything the exam throws at you.

**The prerequisite chain:** Limits → Derivatives → Integrals → Differential Equations and Series. Each level depends on the previous one. A weakness in limits will cascade into difficulties with derivatives, and so on. Use diagnostics to find and fix gaps before they compound.

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing terminology or concepts that appear similar but have distinct meanings.
- Overlooking key assumptions or boundary conditions that limit applicability.
