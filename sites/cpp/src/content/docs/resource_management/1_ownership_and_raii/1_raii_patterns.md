# RAII Patterns

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is the foundational C++ idiom that binds resource
Lifetime to object lifetime. By acquiring resources in constructors and releasing them in
Destructors, RAII guarantees deterministic cleanup even when exceptions propagate through the call
Stack.

## 1.1 Formal Definition

A class follows the RAII pattern when:

1. Its **constructor** acquires a resource (opens a file, locks a mutex, allocates memory).
2. Its **destructor** releases that same resource (closes the file, unlocks the mutex, deallocates
   memory).
3. The class maintains the **invariant**: if construction completes successfully, the resource is
   held; destruction always releases it.

This binding of resource lifetime to object lifetime is the single most important idiom in C++. It
Is not a language feature — it is a convention that the language"s destructor semantics make natural
And safe [N4950 §11.4.7].

## 1.2 Stack Unwinding Guarantee

The critical property that makes RAII work is **stack unwinding**. When an exception propagates out
Of a scope, the C++ runtime calls the destructors of all automatic-storage-duration objects in that
Scope before transferring control to the handler [N4950 §8.4.4].

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <mutex>
#include <stdexcept>

void process_file(const char* path) {
    std::FILE* fp = std::fopen(path, "r");
    if (!fp) throw std::runtime_error("cannot open file");

    char buf[1024];
    std::fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf), fp);
    // If this throws, fp is NEVER closed. Resource leak.

    std::fclose(fp);
}
```

With RAII, the resource is released regardless of how the scope is exited:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <stdexcept>

class FileHandle {
    std::FILE* fp_;
public:
    explicit FileHandle(const char* path) : fp_(std::fopen(path, "r")) {
        if (!fp_) throw std::runtime_error("cannot open file");
    }
    ~FileHandle() {
        if (fp_) std::fclose(fp_);
    }

    FileHandle(const FileHandle&) = delete;
    FileHandle& operator=(const FileHandle&) = delete;

    std::FILE* get() const noexcept { return fp_; }
};

void process_file(const char* path) {
    FileHandle fh(path);
    char buf[1024];
    std::fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf), fh.get());
    // If fread or anything below throws, ~FileHandle() runs.
    // The file is always closed.
}
```

The `finally`. This is the mechanism that enables exception-safe code without manual cleanup.
</aside>
## 1.3 MutexLock Example

```cpp
#include <mutex>

class MutexLock {
    std::mutex& mtx_;
public:
    explicit MutexLock(std::mutex& m) : mtx_(m) { mtx_.lock(); }
    ~MutexLock() { mtx_.unlock(); }

    MutexLock(const MutexLock&) = delete;
    MutexLock& operator=(const MutexLock&) = delete;
};

void thread_safe_operation(std::mutex& mtx) {
    MutexLock lock(mtx);
    // Critical section
    // If an exception is thrown here, ~MutexLock() unlocks the mutex.
}
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--tip">
MutexLock. They are the standard library's RAII wrappers for mutexes.
</aside>
## 1.4 Standard Library RAII Wrappers

The C++ standard library provides RAII wrappers for the most common resource types. Using these
Instead of hand-rolled wrappers is preferred — they are well-tested, well-documented, and handle
Edge cases you might forget.

### `std::lock_guard` and `std::scoped_lock`

Mutex locking is the canonical RAII use case in concurrent code [N4950 §33.4.3]:

```cpp
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

std::mutex mtx;
int shared_data = 0;

void safe_increment() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    // mtx.lock() called in lock_guard constructor
    ++shared_data;
    // mtx.unlock() called in lock_guard destructor, even if this scope
    // is exited via exception, return, or break
}

void safe_multiple_locks(std::mutex& m1, std::mutex& m2) {
    // C++17: scoped_lock acquires multiple locks with deadlock avoidance
    std::scoped_lock lock(m1, m2);
    // Uses a deadlock-free algorithm (similar to std::lock) internally
    // All locks released together on scope exit
}
```

### `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`

Smart pointers are RAII wrappers for heap memory [N4950 §20.11]:

```cpp
#include <memory>

void unique_ptr_ownership() {
    auto ptr = std::make_unique<int[]>(1024);
    // Resource: heap-allocated array of 1024 ints
    // Acquisition: std::make_unique (operator new[])
    // Release: ~unique_ptr calls operator delete[]
    // Exception-safe: even if code below throws, the array is freed
}

void shared_ptr_ownership() {
    auto ptr = std::make_shared<double>(3.14);
    // Resource: heap-allocated double + control block
    // Release: when last shared_ptr is destroyed
}
```

### `std::string``std::vector``std::fstream`

Standard containers and file streams are RAII types. They acquire resources (memory, file
Descriptors) in their constructors and release them in their destructors [N4950 §22.3, §23.3,
§30.4]:

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

void container_and_stream_raii() {
    std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3};
    // Memory acquired in constructor, released in destructor

    std::ofstream ofs("output.txt");
    // File opened in constructor, closed in destructor
    ofs << v[0];
    // Even if ofs.close() is never called, the file is closed when ofs
    // goes out of scope
}
```

## 1.5 Socket Wrapper Example

Network sockets are system resources that must be explicitly closed. A raw `socket()` call without
RAII is a leak waiting to happen:

```cpp
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdexcept>

class Socket {
    int fd_;
public:
    explicit Socket(int domain, int type, int protocol = 0)
        : fd_(::socket(domain, type, protocol))
    {
        if (fd_ < 0) throw std::runtime_error("socket() failed");
    }

    ~Socket() {
        if (fd_ >= 0) ::close(fd_);
    }

    Socket(const Socket&) = delete;
    Socket& operator=(const Socket&) = delete;

    Socket(Socket&& other) noexcept : fd_(other.fd_) {
        other.fd_ = -1;
    }

    Socket& operator=(Socket&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            if (fd_ >= 0) ::close(fd_);
            fd_ = other.fd_;
            other.fd_ = -1;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    int fd() const noexcept { return fd_; }

    void bind(const struct sockaddr* addr, socklen_t len) {
        if (::bind(fd_, addr, len) < 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("bind() failed");
    }

    void listen(int backlog = 128) {
        if (::listen(fd_, backlog) < 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("listen() failed");
    }

    Socket accept() {
        struct sockaddr_storage addr{};
        socklen_t len = sizeof(addr);
        int client_fd = ::accept(fd_, reinterpret_cast<sockaddr*>(&addr), &len);
        if (client_fd < 0) throw std::runtime_error("accept() failed");
        return Socket(client_fd);
    }

private:
    explicit Socket(int fd) : fd_(fd) {}
};
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
The moved-from `Socket` has `fd_ == -1`So its destructor is a no-op. This is the standard pattern
For move-only RAII types that wrap non-copyable OS resources [N4950 §11.4.7].
</aside>
## 1.6 Database Connection Wrapper

Database connections are another resource that benefits from RAII. A connection that is not
Explicitly closed leaks server-side resources (file descriptors, transaction state, connection pool
Slots):

```cpp
#include <stdexcept>

class DbConnection {
    void* handle_;  // opaque database handle (e.g., sqlite3*, MYSQL*)
    bool committed_ = false;
public:
    explicit DbConnection(const char* conn_str)
        : handle_(db_connect(conn_str))
    {
        if (!handle_) throw std::runtime_error("database connection failed");
    }

    ~DbConnection() {
        if (handle_) {
            if (!committed_) db_rollback(handle_);
            db_disconnect(handle_);
        }
    }

    DbConnection(const DbConnection&) = delete;
    DbConnection& operator=(const DbConnection&) = delete;

    void execute(const char* sql) {
        if (db_execute(handle_, sql) != 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("SQL execution failed");
    }

    void commit() {
        db_commit(handle_);
        committed_ = true;
    }

private:
    static void* db_connect(const char* conn_str);
    static void db_disconnect(void* handle);
    static int db_execute(void* handle, const char* sql);
    static void db_commit(void* handle);
    static void db_rollback(void* handle);
};
```

The destructor automatically rolls back uncommitted transactions and disconnects. Even if an
Exception propagates out of the function that created the connection, the database is left in a
Consistent state.

## 1.7 The ScopeGuard Idiom

Sometimes you need to run cleanup code at scope exit that does not fit neatly into a named class.
The **ScopeGuard** idiom provides a general-purpose RAII wrapper for arbitrary cleanup actions:

```cpp
#include <utility>

template <typename F>
class ScopeGuard {
    F func_;
    bool active_ = true;
public:
    explicit ScopeGuard(F&& f) : func_(std::forward<F>(f)) {}
    ~ScopeGuard() { if (active_) func_(); }

    ScopeGuard(ScopeGuard&& other) noexcept
        : func_(std::move(other.func_))
        , active_(other.active_)
    {
        other.active_ = false;
    }

    ScopeGuard(const ScopeGuard&) = delete;
    ScopeGuard& operator=(const ScopeGuard&) = delete;

    void release() noexcept { active_ = false; }
};

// Deduction guide (C++17)
template <typename F>
ScopeGuard(F) -> ScopeGuard<F>;

// Convenience macro for the common case
#define SCOPE_GUARD(expr) \
    ScopeGuard ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE(scope_guard_)([&]() noexcept { expr; })

#define ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE(prefix) prefix ## __LINE__
```

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

void scope_guard_example() {
    std::FILE* fp = std::fopen("data.bin", "rb");
    if (!fp) throw std::runtime_error("cannot open file");

    SCOPE_GUARD(std::fclose(fp));

    char header[4];
    if (std::fread(header, 1, 4, fp) != 4)
        throw std::runtime_error("truncated header");

    // If any code below throws, fclose(fp) is called automatically.
    // The ScopeGuard is released at the end of the scope.

    process_header(header);
}
```

C++23 introduces `std::unexpected` and the Deducing `this` feature, but `std::scope_exit` (a
Generalized ScopeGuard) was not adopted into C++23. Use the implementation above or a library like
[gsl::finally](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) for production code.

## 1.8 RAII and Exception Safety Guarantees

RAII is the mechanism that makes C++'s three exception safety guarantees possible [N4950 §13.2]:

| Guarantee    | Description                                                                    | RAII Role                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No-throw** | The operation never throws.                                                    | RAII destructors are implicitly `noexcept` (since C++11). If a destructor throws during stack unwinding, `std::terminate` is called [N4950 §14.4]. |
| **Strong**   | If the operation throws, the state is rolled back to before the operation.     | RAII objects created during the operation are destroyed during unwinding, automatically releasing any resources they acquired.                     |
| **Basic**    | If the operation throws, no resources are leaked and invariants are preserved. | RAII ensures that all resources are released even if the operation fails partway through.                                                          |

RAII enables the strong guarantee by default: if an exception propagates out of a function, every
RAII object in that function's scope is destroyed, releasing every resource that was acquired. No
Manual `try`/`catch`/`finally` is needed.

```cpp
void transfer(Account& from, Account& to, int amount) {
    // Both locks are RAII. If credit() throws, ~lock_guard unlocks
    // both mutexes. No deadlock, no leaked lock.
    std::scoped_lock lock(from.mtx, to.mtx);
    from.debit(amount);   // might throw
    to.credit(amount);    // might throw — but debit already succeeded
    // Strong guarantee violated: if credit throws, debit is not rolled back.
    // Fix: use a journal/log that is committed only after both succeed.
}
```

## 1.9 RAII vs Garbage Collection

RAII and garbage collection (GC) solve related but different problems:

| Property                      | RAII                                | Garbage Collection                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deterministic destruction** | Yes — destructor runs at scope exit | No — finalizer runs at GC's discretion                                     |
| **Resource types**            | All (memory, files, sockets, locks) | Memory only (finalizers are unreliable for other resources)                |
| **Performance**               | Zero overhead (compile-time)        | Runtime overhead (pause times, GC threads)                                 |
| **Memory leaks**              | Impossible with correct RAII        | Possible (unreferenced but unreachable objects, reference counting cycles) |
| **Latency**                   | Bounded (destructor cost)           | Unbounded (GC pause times)                                                 |

RAII is strictly more general than GC. GC only manages memory; RAII manages **any** resource with
Deterministic cleanup. A GC language like Java still needs `try`-with-resources or `using` blocks
For non-memory resources (files, sockets, locks). In C++, RAII handles all of these uniformly.

Duration are destroyed in reverse order of construction when the scope exits, whether by normal flow
Of control or by exception propagation [N4950 §6.7.2]. This is a language guarantee, not a
Convention.
</aside>
## 1.10 RAII Rule of Thumb

**Every resource acquisition should be wrapped in an RAII type.** If you write a raw call to `new`
`malloc``fopen``socket``pthread_mutex_lock``lock``mmap`Or any other resource acquisition Function,
ask yourself: "What releases this resource, and when?" If the answer is "a manual call Later in the
function," you have a potential leak.

The standard library provides RAII wrappers for most common resources:

| Resource             | Raw Acquisition                    | RAII Wrapper                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Heap memory          | `new``malloc`                      | `std::unique_ptr``std::shared_ptr`Containers |
| File descriptors     | `fopen``open`                      | `std::fstream``std::FILE` wrapper            |
| Mutexes              | `pthread_mutex_lock``mtx.lock()`   | `std::lock_guard``std::scoped_lock`          |
| Dynamic libraries    | `dlopen`                           | `std::unique_ptr` with `dlclose` deleter     |
| Memory mapping       | `mmap`                             | `std::unique_ptr` with `munmap` deleter      |
| Sockets              | `socket`                           | Custom `Socket` class (see §1.5)             |
| Database connections | `sqlite3_open``mysql_real_connect` | Custom connection class (see §1.6)           |

## Common Pitfalls

**Forgetting to delete copy constructor and assignment operator.** RAII types that own a resource
Must be non-copyable (or implement deep copy). If you allow copying, two objects will try to release
The same resource — double-free or double-close. Always `= delete` the copy operations unless you
Have a deliberate deep-copy strategy:

```cpp
class BadRAII {
    std::FILE* fp_;
public:
    explicit BadRAII(const char* path) : fp_(std::fopen(path, "r")) {}
    ~BadRAII() { std::fclose(fp_); }
    // Copy constructor and assignment operator are NOT deleted!
    // Copying a BadRAII causes double-close: UB.
};
```

**Forgetting virtual destructors in polymorphic hierarchies.** If you delete a derived object
Through a base pointer and the base class destructor is not `virtual`Only the base destructor runs —
the derived destructor is never called, and derived resources leak [N4950 §11.4.7]:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    ~Base() { /* releases base resources */ }
    // NOT virtual — derived destructors won't run when deleted via Base*
};

class Derived : public Base {
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> data_;
public:
    ~Derived() { /* releases data_ — BUT THIS NEVER RUNS via Base* delete */ }
};

void leak() {
    Base* p = new Derived();
    delete p;  // ~Base() runs, ~Derived() does NOT run. data_ is leaked.
}
```

**Using `new`/`delete` directly instead of smart pointers.** Raw `new`/`delete` pairs are not
Exception-safe. If an exception occurs between `new` and `delete`The memory is leaked. Always use
`std::make_unique` or `std::make_shared`:

```cpp
// Bad: not exception-safe
auto* obj = new Widget();
do_something_that_might_throw();
delete obj;  // never reached if do_something_that_might_throw() throws

// Good: exception-safe
auto obj = std::make_unique<Widget>();
do_something_that_might_throw();
// ~unique_ptr runs regardless
```

**Throwing in destructors.** Destructors are implicitly `noexcept` in C++11 and later. If a
Destructor throws during stack unwinding (while another exception is active), `std::terminate` is
Called [N4950 §14.4]. If cleanup code in a destructor might throw, catch the exception inside the
Destructor:

```cpp
class SafeResource {
public:
    ~SafeResource() noexcept {
        try {
            cleanup();  // might throw
        } catch (...) {
            // Log the error, but don't propagate
        }
    }
};
```
