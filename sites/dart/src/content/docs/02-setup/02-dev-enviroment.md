## Virtual Devices

Virtual devices can be created by opening the command-palette and selecting
`Flutter: Select Device`And selecting `create android emulator`. However, the performance is not
Accurate and convenience is limited, therefore I recommend using a
[physical device](#physical-devices).

## Physical Devices

Android devices can be use for running builds by enabling `USB debugging` from
`Android developer settings`This is done by:

1. Open settings and navigate to About Phone
2. Tab on the build number 7 times until a confirmation message appear
3. Then enter Developer Options and enable `USB debugging`
4. Plug the phone into the computer with USB connection

Now when selecting VSCode/command-palette/`Flutter: Select Device`The identifier of the phone will
Appear.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Debugging and disconnect the device. Then reconnect the device and check remember device when
Verifying.

## Compiling and Running

With everything setup and a `Flutter: new project` created, the code can now be compiled and ran
With the device selected. Now clicking `F5` (VSCode"s debug mode) will run the command of
`flutter run --debug` and a counter app will be visible on your device. This is JIT compiled, and
Can be hot-reloaded. If you want a release build use the `--release` flag instead, the profile mode
Is a bit more complex, refer to
[Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/build-modes#profile) for more detail.

## Project Structure

Every Dart project is defined by a `pubspec.yaml` file at the root. This is the single source of
Truth for dependencies, metadata, and build configuration — similar to `package.json` (Node),
`Cargo.toml` (Rust), or `go.mod` (Go).

### pubspec.yaml

```yaml
name: my_app
description: "Virtual devices can be created by opening the command-palette and selecting And selecting . However, the performance is not Accurate and convenience is..."
version: 1.0.0
publish_to: "none' # prevent accidental publish to pub.dev

environment:
  sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0'' # SDK version constraint

dependencies:
  path: ^1.9.0 # package from pub.dev
  http: ^1.2.0

dev_dependencies:
  test: ^1.25.0 # only used during development/testing
  lints: ^4.0.0 # lint rules
```

Key fields:

| Field              | Purpose                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Package identifier, must be lowercase_with_underscores              |
| `environment.sdk`  | Dart SDK version constraint. Use caret syntax for compatible ranges |
| `dependencies`     | Packages required at runtime                                        |
| `dev_dependencies` | Packages required only for development (testing, linting, codegen)  |
| `publish_to`       | Set to `"none'` for private packages                                |

### Typical project layout

```
my_app/
├── analysis_options.yaml     # static analysis config
├── pubspec.yaml              # package manifest
├── pubspec.lock              # pinned versions (committed to VCS)
├── bin/
│   └── my_app.dart           # executable entry point (CLI apps)
├── lib/
│   ├── my_app.dart           # library entry point
│   └── src/
│       ├── models.dart
│       └── services.dart
└── test/
    ├── my_app_test.dart
    └── src/
        └── services_test.dart
```

The `bin/` directory is for executable entry points. The `lib/` directory contains reusable library
Code. The `test/` directory mirrors `lib/` structure for test files.

## Packages and Dependencies

### pub get

After editing `pubspec.yaml`Run:

```bash
dart pub get
```

This resolves dependencies, downloads packages to a local cache (`~/.pub-cache`), and generates
`pubspec.lock` and the `.dart_tool/package_config.json` file used by the analyzer and compiler.

### pub add

To add a dependency interactively:

```bash
dart pub add http           # add runtime dependency
dart pub add dev:test       # add dev dependency
dart pub add http --sdk=flutter  # add Flutter plugin
```

### pub outdated

Check for updates:

```bash
dart pub outdated
```

Output shows current versions, resolvable versions, and latest versions for each dependency.

### pub remove

```bash
dart pub remove http
```

### Dependency resolution

Dart uses a **pubspec lockfile** model. `pubspec.lock` pins exact versions. Commit `pubspec.lock` to
Version control for applications. For libraries (packages intended to be consumed by others), you do
**not** commit `pubspec.lock` — consumers resolve versions themselves.

## Static Analysis: dart analyze

```bash
dart analyze
```

The analyzer checks for type errors, unused imports, missing returns, and lint violations. It reads
`analysis_options.yaml` for configuration:

```yaml
include: package:lints/recommended.yaml

analyzer:
  exclude:
    - build/**
    - '**/*.g.dart'
  errors:
    missing_return: error
    unnecessary_import: warning
```

Common lint packages:

| Package              | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lints`              | Official Google lint rules (`recommended.yaml` / `core.yaml`) |
| `very_good_analysis` | Very Good Ventures' stricter ruleset                          |
| `flutter_lints`      | Flutter-specific lint rules                                   |

Run with info-level output:

```bash
dart analyze --fatal-infos
```

In CI, use `dart analyze --fatal-infos` and fail the build on any finding.

## Formatting: dart format

```bash
dart format .                # format all files in-place
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .   # CI: fail if unformatted
dart format --output=show .  # dry-run, show diff
```

Dart has an opinionated formatter (similar to `gofmt`). There are no configuration options — the
Formatter enforces a single canonical style. This eliminates style debates in code review.

Line length defaults to 80 characters. Change it in `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
formatter:
  page_width: 120
```

## Running Code

### dart run

```bash
dart run bin/my_app.dart arg1 arg2
```

`dart run` compiles and executes in one step. For JIT performance during development, this is the
Standard command.

### dart compile

For production, compile to a standalone binary:

```bash
dart compile exe bin/my_app.dart -o my_app    # native executable
dart compile aot-snapshot bin/my_app.dart -o my_app.aot  # AOT snapshot
dart compile js bin/my_app.dart -o my_app.js   # JavaScript
dart compile wasm bin/my_app.dart              # WebAssembly
```

`dart compile exe` produces a self-contained binary with no VM dependency. Binary sizes are 3–10 MB
for a minimal application.

### flutter run

```bash
flutter run                     # debug mode (JIT, hot reload)
flutter run --release           # release mode (AOT)
flutter run --profile           # profiling mode
flutter run -d chrome           # run on Chrome
flutter run -d macos            # run on macOS desktop
flutter run -d all              # run on all connected devices
```

Hot reload during debug: press `r` in the terminal. Hot restart (full state reset): press `R`.

## Debugging

### VS Code Debugger

Set breakpoints by clicking the gutter (line number area) or pressing `F9`. Press `F5` to start
Debugging. The debug panel shows variables, call stack, and breakpoints.

### Dart DevTools

DevTools is a suite of performance and debugging tools:

```bash
dart devtools                     # launch standalone DevTools
flutter pub global activate devtools && dart devtools
```

DevTools provides:

- **Widget Inspector** (Flutter): visualize the widget tree, select widgets to find source code
- **Timeline**: CPU and GPU frame profiling
- **Memory**: heap snapshot, allocation tracing, leak detection
- **Network**: HTTP request inspection
- **Logging**: view `print()` and `debugPrint()` output
- **Coverage**: code coverage visualization

### Observatory (Legacy)

The VM service is available at `http://localhost:XXXXX/` when running in debug mode. DevTools
Connects to this service. You can also access it directly in a browser for low-level VM inspection.

## Testing Basics

### Writing a test

```dart
// test/calculator_test.dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:my_app/calculator.dart';

void main() {
  group('Calculator', () {
    late Calculator calc;

    setUp(() {
      calc = Calculator();
    });

    test('adds two numbers', () {
      expect(calc.add(2, 3), equals(5));
    });

    test('throws on division by zero', () {
      expect(() => calc.divide(10, 0), throwsA(isA<ArgumentError>()));
    });
  });
}
```

### Running tests

```bash
dart test                        # run all tests
dart test test/calculator_test.dart  # run specific file
dart test --coverage=coverage    # generate coverage
```

### Test structure

- **`test()`**: Individual test case. Describe with a string that reads as a specification.
- **`group()`**: Logical grouping of related tests. Groups can be nested.
- **`setUp()`** / **`tearDown()`**: Run before/after each test in a group.
- **`setUpAll()`** / **`tearDownAll()`**: Run once before/after all tests in a group.

### Assertions

```dart
expect(value, equals(expected));              // equality
expect(value, isNull);                        // null check
expect(value, isNotNull);                     // non-null check
expect(value, isA<MyType>());                 // type check
expect(value, greaterThan(10));               // comparison
expect(value, contains('substring'));         // string contains
expect(list, containsAll([1, 2, 3]));          // collection contains
expect(() => fn(), throwsException);           // throws check
expect(fn(), completes);                      // Future completes
expect(fn(), completion(equals(42)));          // Future completes with value
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Not committing `pubspec.lock` for applications**: For apps (not libraries), always commit
  `pubspec.lock`. Without it, different developers or CI runs may resolve different dependency
  versions, causing "works on my machine" issues.
- **Running `dart analyze` before `dart pub get`**: The analyzer needs the
  `.dart_tool/package_config.json` generated by `pub get`. Run `pub get` first.
- **Ignoring `dev_dependencies` in production**: `dev_dependencies` like `test` and `lints` are not
  included in release builds, but they must be present during development.
- **Using `flutter run` for benchmarking**: Debug mode has assertions enabled, no optimizations, and
  uses JIT. Always use `--release` or `--profile` for performance measurements.

## Summary

This topic covers the core concepts of development enviroment, including underlying theory,
practical implementation, and key applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- core concepts and terminology
- algorithms and computational thinking
- practical implementation
- security and ethical considerations
- applications in the real world

Understanding these concepts thoroughly is essential for both examinations and practical
programming, and requires both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice.

## Worked Examples

Worked examples demonstrating the application of key concepts are covered in the detailed sub-pages
linked above.

## Intuition

The development environment is where your code comes alive. VS Code with Dart and Flutter extensions gives you autocompletion, debugging, and hot reload in one editor. The pubspec.yaml file is the single source of truth for your project's dependencies, SDK constraints, and metadata -- think of it as package.json for Dart. The dart analyze command catches errors before runtime, and dart format enforces a single canonical style so you never argue about formatting in code reviews. DevTools provides widget inspection, CPU profiling, memory analysis, and network inspection for Flutter apps.
