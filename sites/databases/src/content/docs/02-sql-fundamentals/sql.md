## SQL Standards and Dialects

SQL is defined by ANSI/ISO standards (SQL-86, SQL-89, SQL-92, SQL:1999, SQL:2003, SQL:2006,
SQL:2008, SQL:2011, SQL:2016, SQL:2019, SQL:2023). No database implements the full standard.
PostgreSQL has the broadest standards compliance among open-source databases. MySQL diverges
Significantly. SQLite implements a large subset but omits many features (e.g., RIGHT JOIN, FULL
OUTER JOIN were added in 3.39.0, 2022).

When this document specifies behaviour, it defaults to PostgreSQL syntax unless otherwise noted.

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL defines and modifies the database schema. These statements are transactional in PostgreSQL and
SQLite but often auto-commit in MySQL.

### CREATE TABLE

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id       SERIAL        PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name   VARCHAR(100)  NOT NULL,
    last_name    VARCHAR(100)  NOT NULL,
    email        VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL,
    hire_date    DATE          NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    salary       NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (salary > 0),
    department_id INTEGER      REFERENCES departments(dept_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    CONSTRAINT uq_email UNIQUE (email),
    CONSTRAINT chk_salary_range CHECK (salary >= 30000 AND salary <= 1000000)
);
```

Key elements:

- `SERIAL` (PostgreSQL) / `AUTO_INCREMENT` (MySQL) / `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` (SQLite) for
  auto-generating keys
- `NOT NULL` -- the column must have a value
- `UNIQUE` -- no two rows can have the same value in this column
- `CHECK` -- an arbitrary boolean expression evaluated on insert/update
- `DEFAULT` -- value used when no explicit value is provided
- `REFERENCES` -- foreign key constraint with referential action

### Column Data Types

| Type Category   | PostgreSQL Types                     | Notes                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integers        | `SMALLINT``INTEGER``BIGINT`          | `INTEGER` is 4 bytes, `BIGINT` is 8 bytes                                       |
| Fixed precision | `NUMERIC(p,s)``DECIMAL(p,s)`         | Exact arithmetic; `NUMERIC(10,2)` holds up to 99,999,999.99                     |
| Floating point  | `REAL``DOUBLE PRECISION`             | Inexact; avoid for financial data                                               |
| Variable string | `VARCHAR(n)``TEXT`                   | `VARCHAR` with length is a constraint, not a storage optimisation in PostgreSQL |
| Fixed string    | `CHAR(n)`                            | Padded with spaces; rarely useful                                               |
| Boolean         | `BOOLEAN`                            | `TRUE``FALSE``NULL`                                                             |
| Date/Time       | `DATE``TIME``TIMESTAMP``TIMESTAMPTZ` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` stores UTC; always prefer it over `TIMESTAMP`                     |
| Binary          | `BYTEA`                              | Variable-length binary data                                                     |
| JSON            | `JSON``JSONB`                        | `JSONB` is stored in decomposed binary form; faster to query                    |
| UUID            | `UUID`                               | Requires the `uuid-ossp` or `pgcrypto` extension                                |
| Array           | `INTEGER[]``TEXT[]`                  | PostgreSQL-specific extension                                                   |
| Network         | `INET``CIDR``MACADDR`                | PostgreSQL-specific; enforces valid IP/MAC formats                              |

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--tip">
You lose the context of when the event actually occurred. `TIMESTAMPTZ` converts to UTC on storage
And back to the session timezone on retrieval.


### ALTER TABLE

```sql
ADD COLUMN:
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN middle_name VARCHAR(100);

DROP COLUMN:
ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN middle_name;

RENAME COLUMN:
ALTER TABLE employees RENAME COLUMN first_name TO given_name;

ALTER COLUMN TYPE:
ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN salary TYPE NUMERIC(12,2);

ADD CONSTRAINT:
ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT chk_hire_date CHECK (hire_date >= "2000-01-01');

DROP CONSTRAINT:
ALTER TABLE employees DROP CONSTRAINT chk_salary_range;
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
To the table for the duration of the operation. On large tables, adding a column with a default
Value or changing a column type can take hours. Use `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT NULL`
(which is metadata-only in PostgreSQL 11+) or pg_partman for zero-downtime migrations.


### DROP TABLE

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees CASCADE;
-- CASCADE drops all objects that depend on this table (views, foreign keys)
```

### CREATE INDEX

```sql
B-tree (default):
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_email ON employees(email);

Unique index:
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_employees_email ON employees(email);

Composite index:
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_dept_hire ON employees(department_id, hire_date);

Concurrent index (no lock on reads/writes):
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_employees_email ON employees(email);
```

### CREATE TABLE AS / LIKE

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees_backup AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 1 = 0;
-- Creates an empty copy with the same columns and data types

CREATE TABLE employees_archive (LIKE employees INCLUDING ALL);
-- Copies columns, constraints, defaults, indexes, and storage settings
```

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary, department_id)
VALUES ('Ada', 'Lovelace', 'ada@example.com', '2024-01-15', 150000, 1);

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary)
VALUES
    ('Grace', 'Hopper', 'grace@example.com', '2024-02-01', 140000),
    ('Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'margaret@example.com', '2024-03-01', 145000);

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary)
SELECT first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary
FROM contractors
WHERE conversion_date IS NOT NULL;
```

### UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department_id = 3 AND hire_date &lt; '2023-01-01';

UPDATE employees e
SET salary = (
    SELECT AVG(salary) * 1.05
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
)
WHERE e.emp_id = 42;
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Same `WHERE` clause first to verify which rows will be affected. Consider wrapping destructive
Updates in a transaction with a `SAVEPOINT` so you can roll back if the results are wrong.


### DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE hire_date &lt; '2020-01-01' AND department_id IS NULL;

DELETE FROM employees e
USING departures d
WHERE e.emp_id = d.emp_id AND d.departure_date &lt; CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

### TRUNCATE

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE audit_log;
-- Faster than DELETE FROM audit_log for full-table clears
-- Not transactional in all databases (PostgreSQL: transactional; MySQL: DDL, auto-commits)
-- Resets identity columns (SERIAL)
-- Cannot be used on tables referenced by foreign keys (unless CASCADE)
```

### UPSERT (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT)

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, first_name, last_name, email, salary)
VALUES (42, 'Ada', 'Lovelace', 'ada@example.com', 160000)
ON CONFLICT (emp_id)
DO UPDATE SET
    salary = EXCLUDED.salary,
    email = EXCLUDED.email
WHERE employees.salary &lt; EXCLUDED.salary;
```

`EXCLUDED` is a special table reference that holds the row that was proposed for insertion.

## SELECT: Query Fundamentals

### Basic Query Structure

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] select_list
FROM table_name [alias]
[JOIN join_clause]
[WHERE filter_condition]
[GROUP BY grouping_columns]
[HAVING group_filter]
[ORDER BY sort_columns]
[LIMIT row_count]
[OFFSET row_offset];
```

The logical order of execution (not the written order):

```text
1. FROM       -- identify the source relation(s)
2. WHERE      -- filter rows before grouping
3. GROUP BY   -- group rows by expression
4. HAVING     -- filter groups
5. SELECT     -- evaluate expressions, compute aliases
6. DISTINCT   -- remove duplicate rows
7. ORDER BY   -- sort the result set
8. LIMIT/OFFSET -- paginate
```

### WHERE Clause Predicates

```sql
Comparison operators:
WHERE salary > 100000
WHERE department_id = 5
WHERE name != 'Unknown'

Pattern matching:
WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com'
WHERE name ILIKE 'ada%'              -- case-insensitive (PostgreSQL)
WHERE code ~ '^[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}$'   -- POSIX regex (PostgreSQL)

Range:
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'

Set membership:
WHERE department_id IN (1, 3, 5, 7)
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT dept_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'NYC')

NULL handling:
WHERE manager_id IS NULL
WHERE email IS NOT NULL

Logical operators:
WHERE (salary > 100000 OR department_id = 1) AND hire_date >= '2022-01-01'
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
`WHERE column = NULL` never matches any rows. Use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`. Similarly,
`NULL AND TRUE` is `NULL``NULL OR FALSE` is `NULL`And `NOT NULL` is `NULL`. This three-valued Logic
is the single greatest source of SQL bugs.


### ORDER BY

```sql
ORDER BY salary DESC, hire_date ASC;

ORDER BY department_id NULLS LAST, salary DESC;  -- PostgreSQL extension
ORDER BY department_id NULLS FIRST;               -- PostgreSQL extension
```

### LIMIT and OFFSET

```sql
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;   -- rows 41-60

-- PostgreSQL 13+ for simple pagination:
FETCH FIRST 20 ROWS ONLY;

-- Keyset pagination (avoids OFFSET performance issues):
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_id > 1000   -- last seen ID from previous page
ORDER BY order_id
LIMIT 20;
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--tip">
Offsets (e.g., `OFFSET 100000`), this is slow because the database still processes 100,000 rows. Use
Keyset pagination (also called seek pagination) instead:
`WHERE id &gt; last_seen_id ORDER BY id LIMIT 20`.


## Joins

### INNER JOIN

Returns only rows where the join condition is satisfied in both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.dept_id;
```

### LEFT OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows from the left table, with NULL for unmatched right-table columns.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.dept_id;
-- Employees without a department appear with department_name = NULL
```

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows from the right table, with NULL for unmatched left-table columns.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.dept_id;
-- Departments with no employees appear with first_name = NULL
```

### FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows from both tables, with NULL where no match exists.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.dept_id;
-- Unmatched employees AND unmatched departments both appear
```

### CROSS JOIN

Returns the Cartesian product: every row from the left combined with every row from the right.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, s.skill_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN skills s;
-- If employees has 100 rows and skills has 50 rows, result has 5000 rows
```

### SELF JOIN

A table joined to itself, for hierarchical data (employee-manager, bill-of-materials).

```sql
SELECT e.first_name AS employee, m.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;
```

### Multiple Joins and Join Order

```sql
SELECT c.name AS customer, o.order_id, p.product_name, oi.quantity
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC, c.name;
```

The query planner determines the physical join order, which may differ from the written order. Use
`EXPLAIN` to verify.

## Subqueries

### Scalar Subquery

Returns exactly one row and one column. Can appear anywhere an expression is valid.

```sql
SELECT first_name, salary,
    (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS company_avg,
    salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS delta
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 3;
```

### Correlated Subquery

References columns from the outer query. Executed once per outer row (often slow).

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id
);
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Tables, this is $O(n)$ subquery executions. Rewrite as a join or a window function when possible:

```sql
-- Equivalent join (in most cases faster):
SELECT e.first_name, e.salary, d.avg_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > d.avg_salary;
```


### EXISTS and NOT EXISTS

Tests whether a subquery returns any rows. The most efficient form of subquery.

```sql
-- Customers who have placed at least one order:
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

-- Departments with no employees:
SELECT d.dept_id, d.department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e
    WHERE e.department_id = d.dept_id
);
```

### IN and NOT IN

```sql
-- Employees in specific departments:
SELECT first_name FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (1, 2, 3);

-- Employees not in any department (works with NULLs):
SELECT first_name FROM employees
WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT dept_id FROM departments);
-- WARNING: if any dept_id is NULL, NOT IN returns no rows at all!
-- Use NOT EXISTS instead when NULLs are possible.
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Evaluates to `x != 1 AND x != 2 AND x != NULL`And `x != NULL` is `NULL` (not `TRUE`). Always use
`NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN` when the subquery might return NULL values.


### ANY and ALL

```sql
-- Employees earning more than ANY employee in department 5:
SELECT first_name FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5);

-- Employees earning more than ALL employees in department 5:
SELECT first_name FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5);
```

## Set Operations

Combine the results of two or more queries. All queries must have the same number of columns and
Compatible data types.

```sql
UNION (removes duplicates):
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION
SELECT city FROM suppliers;

UNION ALL (keeps duplicates; faster):
SELECT event_type FROM audit_log_2023
UNION ALL
SELECT event_type FROM audit_log_2024;

INTERSECT:
SELECT customer_id FROM orders_2023
INTERSECT
SELECT customer_id FROM orders_2024;

EXCEPT:
SELECT customer_id FROM customers
EXCEPT
SELECT customer_id FROM churned_accounts;
```

## Aggregate Functions and Grouping

### Aggregate Functions

```sql
COUNT(*)          -- count all rows, including NULLs
COUNT(column)     -- count non-NULL values in column
COUNT(DISTINCT column) -- count unique non-NULL values
SUM(column)       -- sum of non-NULL numeric values
AVG(column)       -- arithmetic mean of non-NULL numeric values
MIN(column)       -- minimum non-NULL value
MAX(column)       -- maximum non-NULL value
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
Treat NULL as zero, use `AVG(COALESCE(salary, 0))`But understand that this changes the semantics:
NULL means "unknown," not "zero."


### GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS headcount, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

Every column in the `SELECT` list must either appear in the `GROUP BY` clause or be wrapped in an
Aggregate function. PostgreSQL is strict about this; MySQL (with `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` disabled)
Allows ambiguous queries.

### HAVING

Filters groups after aggregation. `WHERE` filters rows before aggregation.

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= '2022-01-01'    -- filter individual rows first
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 100000         -- then filter aggregated groups
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

### GROUPING SETS, CUBE, ROLLUP

PostgreSQL extensions for multi-level grouping:

```sql
-- GROUPING SETS: specify multiple groupings in one query
SELECT department_id, job_title, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (department_id, job_title),
    (department_id),
    ()
);

-- ROLLUP: hierarchical subtotals
SELECT region, country, SUM(revenue)
FROM sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP (region, country);
-- Produces: (region, country), (region), ()

-- CUBE: all possible combinations
SELECT region, channel, product_line, SUM(revenue)
FROM sales
GROUP BY CUBE (region, channel, product_line);
-- Produces: all 8 combinations of 3 columns
```

## Window Functions

Window functions perform a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row. Unlike
Aggregate functions with `GROUP BY`They do not collapse rows -- every input row produces an output
Row.

### Syntax

```sql
function_name(args) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    [ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC|DESC] [NULLS {FIRST|LAST}]]
    [frame_clause: ROWS|RANGE BETWEEN start AND end]
)
```

### ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK

```sql
SELECT emp_id, department_id, salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num,
    RANK()       OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

| salary | ROW_NUMBER | RANK | DENSE_RANK |
| ------ | ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
| 150000 | 1          | 1    | 1          |
| 150000 | 2          | 1    | 1          |
| 140000 | 3          | 3    | 2          |
| 140000 | 4          | 3    | 2          |
| 130000 | 5          | 5    | 3          |

- `ROW_NUMBER`: assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within the partition
- `RANK`: ties get the same rank; next rank skips (1, 1, 3, 3, 5)
- `DENSE_RANK`: ties get the same rank; next rank does not skip (1, 1, 2, 2, 3)

### LAG and LEAD

Access values from preceding or following rows:

```sql
SELECT order_date, revenue,
    LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS prev_day_revenue,
    LEAD(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS next_day_revenue,
    revenue - LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS day_over_day_change
FROM daily_sales;
```

### Aggregate Window Functions

```sql
-- Running total:
SELECT order_date, amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total;

-- Moving average (7-day):
SELECT order_date, amount,
    AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS ma_7day;

-- Percentage of total:
SELECT department_id, salary,
    salary / SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS pct_of_dept_salary
FROM employees;

-- First and last value in partition:
SELECT emp_id, department_id, hire_date,
    FIRST_VALUE(hire_date) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date) AS earliest_hire,
    LAST_VALUE(hire_date) OVER (
        PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS latest_hire
FROM employees;
```

</aside>
<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
`RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`Which includes all peers (rows with the same
ORDER BY value). This means `SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date)` gives a running total that includes
All rows with the same date. Use `ROWS` instead of `RANGE` if you want strict positional framing.


## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs (the `WITH` clause) create named temporary result sets that exist for the duration of a single
Query. They improve readability and enable recursive queries.

### Non-Recursive CTEs

```sql
WITH dept_stats AS (
    SELECT department_id,
           COUNT(*) AS headcount,
           AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
           MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
),
top_earners AS (
    SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary, d.department_id, d.avg_salary
    FROM employees e
    JOIN dept_stats d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
    WHERE e.salary = d.max_salary
)
SELECT * FROM top_earners ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

### Data-Modifying CTEs

PostgreSQL allows INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE inside CTEs:

```sql
WITH archived AS (
    DELETE FROM orders
    WHERE order_date &lt; '2023-01-01'
    RETURNING *
)
INSERT INTO order_archive
SELECT * FROM archived;
```

### Recursive CTEs

Recursive CTEs solve problems involving hierarchical or graph-like data: org charts,
Bill-of-materials, thread/comment trees, path finding.

```sql
-- Find all employees in the hierarchy under employee 42 (direct and indirect reports):
WITH RECURSIVE hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: the manager
    SELECT emp_id, first_name, manager_id, 1 AS depth
    FROM employees
    WHERE emp_id = 42

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: direct reports of each row in the hierarchy
    SELECT e.emp_id, e.first_name, e.manager_id, h.depth + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.emp_id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy ORDER BY depth, first_name;
```

```mermaid
graph TD

Recursion depth to 100 by default (`cte_max_recursion_depth`). PostgreSQL has no recursion depth

## CASE Expressions

```sql
-- Simple CASE:
SELECT salary,
    CASE salary
        WHEN &lt; 50000 THEN 'Entry'
        WHEN &lt; 100000 THEN 'Mid'
        WHEN &lt; 150000 THEN 'Senior'
        ELSE 'Executive'
    END AS salary_band
FROM employees;

-- Searched CASE:
SELECT first_name, salary,
    CASE
        WHEN salary >= 150000 AND department_id = 1 THEN 'Senior IC'
        WHEN salary >= 150000 THEN 'Senior'
        WHEN department_id IS NULL THEN 'Unassigned'
        ELSE 'Standard'
    END AS classification
FROM employees;
```

CASE is an expression, not a statement. It returns a value and can be used anywhere an expression is
Valid: in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and even inside other CASE expressions.

```sql
-- CASE in ORDER BY for custom sorting:
SELECT * FROM tasks
ORDER BY
    CASE priority
        WHEN 'critical' THEN 1
        WHEN 'high' THEN 2
        WHEN 'medium' THEN 3
        WHEN 'low' THEN 4
        ELSE 5
    END,
    created_at;
```

## NULL Handling

```sql
COALESCE(a, b, c)       -- returns first non-NULL argument
NULLIF(a, b)            -- returns NULL if a = b, otherwise returns a
COALESCE(NULLIF(phone, ''), '(no phone)')

-- Conditional aggregation (count only non-NULL):
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    COUNT(manager_id) AS has_manager,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(manager_id) AS no_manager
FROM employees;

-- NULL-safe comparison:
-- a IS DISTINCT FROM b (PostgreSQL standard)
-- a &lt;=&gt; b (MySQL, also supported by PostgreSQL)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE commission_rate IS DISTINCT FROM 0;
-- Returns rows where commission_rate is NULL or different from 0
```

Division-by-zero errors: `ratio = a / NULLIF(b, 0)` returns NULL instead of raising an error when
`b` is zero.

## Intuition

SQL is like a conversation with your database. You ask questions (SELECT), you give instructions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and you make requests (CREATE, ALTER). The grammar of SQL is the structure of this conversation: each sentence must follow the rules, or the database will not understand you.

Joins are like matching puzzle pieces. An inner join finds only the pieces that fit together. A left join keeps all the pieces from the left side and matches what it can from the right. Understanding joins is understanding how your tables relate to each other, like understanding how departments relate to employees in an organization.

## Common Pitfalls

### Off-by-One Errors with BETWEEN

`BETWEEN` is inclusive on both ends: `WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'` includes
Both endpoints. If `date` is a `TIMESTAMPTZ``BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'` actually means
Up to `2024-01-31 00:00:00`Excluding all timestamps on January 31st after midnight. Use
`WHERE date >= '2024-01-01' AND date &lt; '2024-02-01'` for date-range comparisons with timestamps.

### Assuming ORDER BY Without Explicit ORDER BY

SQL tables and result sets have no guaranteed ordering unless you specify `ORDER BY`. A query
Without `ORDER BY` may return rows in any order, and that order may change between executions, after
An `ANALYZE`Or after a version upgrade.

### Using DISTINCT as a Substitute for Proper Joins

`SELECT DISTINCT` to remove duplicates caused by an incorrect join is a performance anti-pattern. If
Your join produces duplicates, the join condition or the schema is wrong. Fix the root cause.

### Forgetting That COUNT(column) Skips NULLs

`COUNT(*)` counts rows. `COUNT(column)` counts non-NULL values. `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` counts
Unique non-NULL values. Confusing these produces incorrect results, especially in reports and
Dashboards.

### Implicit Type Coercion

PostgreSQL is strict about types: `WHERE id = '42'` works (string is cast to integer) but
`WHERE name = 42` raises an error. MySQL silently coerces: `WHERE 'abc' = 0` evaluates to `TRUE`
Because the string is cast to zero. Always match types explicitly.

### Not Using Parameterised Queries

String-concatenating values into SQL queries creates SQL injection vulnerabilities and prevents
Query plan caching. Always use parameterised queries (prepared statements) in application code:

```text
-- WRONG:
"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + user_input + "'"

-- CORRECT:
"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1", [user_input]
```

## Summary

This topic covers the essential chemistry of sql fundamentals, including key reactions, underlying
theories, and practical applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- key chemical principles and theories
- mathematical relationships in chemistry
- practical techniques and apparatus
- applications of chemistry in industry
- environmental and ethical considerations

Mastery of these concepts requires both theoretical understanding and the ability to apply knowledge
to unfamiliar contexts, particularly in calculation and practical questions.
