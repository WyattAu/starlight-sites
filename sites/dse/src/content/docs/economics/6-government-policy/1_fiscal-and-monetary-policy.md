## Overview of Macroeconomic Policy

Macroeconomic policy refers to government actions designed to influence the overall performance of
The economy. The primary objectives are:

1. **Economic growth:** Sustained increase in real GDP and living standards
2. **Full employment:** Minimising cyclical unemployment (achieving the natural rate of
   unemployment)
3. **Price stability:** Keeping inflation low and stable ( targeting 2-3%)
4. **Balance of payments stability:** Avoiding persistent, unsustainable current account deficits
5. **Equitable income distribution:** Reducing excessive inequality

The three main categories of macroeconomic policy are **fiscal policy** (government spending and
Taxation), **monetary policy** (money supply and interest rates), and **supply-side policy**
(improving the productive capacity of the economy).

This file assumes familiarity with the monetary policy tools covered in
[../8-money-and-banking/1_money-and-banking](../8-money-and-banking/1_money-and-banking) and the
national income concepts covered in
[../5-macroeconomic-indicators/1_national-income](../5-macroeconomic-indicators/1_national-income).

## Fiscal Policy

### Definition

Fiscal policy is the use of government spending, taxation, and borrowing to influence the level of
Aggregate demand, economic activity, and employment in the economy.

### Government Spending

Government spending falls into two categories:

| Category            | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current expenditure | Day-to-day spending on goods and services: public sector wages, healthcare, education, defence, welfare. Recurrent and predictable.               |
| Capital expenditure | Investment in physical infrastructure: roads, bridges, public housing, airports, hospitals, schools. Increases the economy's productive capacity. |

Current expenditure directly affects aggregate demand in the short run. Capital expenditure affects
Both aggregate demand (in the short run, through construction spending) and aggregate supply (in the
Long run, by expanding the economy's productive capacity).

### Taxation

Taxes are compulsory payments to the government. They serve two functions in macroeconomic policy:
Financing government expenditure and influencing economic behaviour.

| Tax Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct taxes   | Taxes on income and wealth: personal income tax, corporate profits tax, property tax. These reduce disposable income and affect incentives to work and invest. |
| Indirect taxes | Taxes on spending: VAT/sales tax, excise duties, customs duties. These raise prices and reduce real purchasing power.                                          |

### Budget Balance

$$\mathrm{Budget balance} = T - G$$

Where `T` is total tax revenue and `G` is total government expenditure (excluding debt interest
Payments for simplicity).

| Situation       | Condition | Effect on AD                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Budget surplus  | `T \gt G` | Contractionary (reduces AD)                                                  |
| Balanced budget | `T = G`   | Neutral (some say mildly expansionary due to the balanced budget multiplier) |
| Budget deficit  | `T \lt G` | Expansionary (increases AD)                                                  |

## Expansionary Fiscal Policy

### Objective

To stimulate aggregate demand during a recession or when the economy is operating below full
Employment (a recessionary gap exists).

### Instruments

| Instrument                   | Mechanism                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Increase government spending | Direct injection into the circular flow of income; raises AD; multiplier effect amplifies the initial spending.     |
| Decrease taxes               | Increases disposable income; households spend more; firms invest more; AD rises.                                    |
| Increase transfer payments   | Increases the income of recipients (unemployed, low-income households); they spend most of it (high MPC); AD rises. |
| Investment tax credits       | Reduces the cost of investment for firms; encourages capital spending; AD rises and LRAS may shift right.           |

### The Multiplier Effect

The multiplier effect is the mechanism by which an initial change in spending (or taxation) produces
A larger final change in national income.

When the government increases spending by an amount, this becomes income for someone else (workers,
Suppliers). Those recipients spend a portion of this additional income (determined by the marginal
Propensity to consume, MPC), which becomes income for yet others. This process continues, with each
Round of spending generating further income and further spending, though the amount gets smaller
Each round.

**Simple spending multiplier (no taxes, no imports):**

$$k = \frac{1}{1 - \mathrm{MPC}} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{MPS}}$$

Where MPC = marginal propensity to consume, MPS = marginal propensity to save.

$$\mathrm{MPC} + \mathrm{MPS} = 1$$

**Complex multiplier (with taxes and imports):**

$$k = \frac{1}{\mathrm{MPS} + \mathrm{MPT} + \mathrm{MPM}}$$

Where MPT = marginal propensity to tax (proportion of additional income paid in tax) and MPM =
Marginal propensity to import (proportion of additional income spent on imports).

**Why do taxes and imports reduce the multiplier?** Taxes and imports are **leakages** from the
Circular flow. Each round of spending, some income is taxed (not available for consumption) and some
Is spent on imports (not part of domestic demand). These leakages reduce the amount of income
Available for the next round of domestic spending, shrinking the multiplier.

$$\Delta Y = k \times \Delta G$$

**Tax multiplier (absolute value is smaller than the spending multiplier):**

$$\Delta Y = -\mathrm{MPC} \times k \times \Delta T$$

A tax cut of `Delta T` increases disposable income by `Delta T`But only `MPC x Delta T` is spent
(the rest is saved). This initial spending is then multiplied. The tax multiplier is always smaller
Than the spending multiplier (in absolute value) because part of the tax cut is saved, not spent.

### Worked Example: Expansionary Fiscal Policy

The government increases spending by USD 100 billion. MPC = 0.8, MPT = 0.15, MPM = 0.05.

$$k = \frac{1}{0.2 + 0.15 + 0.05} = \frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5$$

$$\Delta Y = 2.5 \times 100 = 250$$

National income increases by USD 250 billion. The initial USD 100 billion injection generates an
Additional USD 150 billion through the multiplier process.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Comparing Spending Multiplier and Tax Multiplier</summary>

MPC = 0.6, MPT = 0.2, MPM = 0.1.

Complex multiplier = `1/(0.4 + 0.2 + 0.1) = 1/0.7 = 1.43`.

If government increases spending by USD 80 billion: `Delta Y = 1.43 \times 80 = 114.4` billion.

If government cuts taxes by USD 80 billion: Tax multiplier = `-0.6 \times 1.43 = -0.86`.
`Delta Y = -0.86 \times (-80) = 68.6` billion.

The spending increase (114.4) is 67% more effective than the tax cut (68.6) because the full
Spending is injected, while only 60% of the tax cut is spent (the rest is saved).

If instead the government cut taxes by USD 100 billion:

$$\Delta Y = -0.8 \times 2.5 \times (-100) = 200$$

National income increases by USD 200 billion. The tax cut is less effective than the spending
Increase (200 vs 250) because part of the tax cut is saved.

## Contractionary Fiscal Policy

### Objective

To reduce aggregate demand when the economy is overheating (operating above full employment,
Inflationary gap).

### Instruments

| Instrument                   | Mechanism                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decrease government spending | Reduces the injection into the economy; AD falls; multiplier effect amplifies the reduction. |
| Increase taxes               | Reduces disposable income; households and firms have less to spend; AD falls.                |
| Decrease transfer payments   | Reduces the income of recipients; their spending falls; AD falls.                            |

### Worked Example: Contractionary Fiscal Policy

The economy is experiencing demand-pull inflation. The government cuts spending by USD 50 billion.
MPC = 0.75, MPT = 0.1, MPM = 0.1.

$$k = \frac{1}{0.25 + 0.1 + 0.1} = \frac{1}{0.45} = 2.22$$

$$\Delta Y = 2.22 \times (-50) = -111$$

National income falls by approximately USD 111 billion, reducing inflationary pressure.

## Automatic Stabilisers

Automatic stabilisers are built-in features of the fiscal system that automatically reduce the
Amplitude of the business cycle without requiring new legislation or discretionary action.

### Progressive Income Tax

During an expansion: incomes rise, pushing taxpayers into higher tax brackets. The average tax rate
Rises, reducing the proportion of additional income available for consumption. This dampens the
Expansion.

During a contraction: incomes fall, pushing taxpayers into lower tax brackets. The average tax rate
Falls, leaving more disposable income available for consumption. This cushions the contraction.

### Unemployment Benefits and Welfare

During a contraction: unemployment rises, more people claim benefits. Government transfer payments
Automatically increase, supporting household incomes and consumption. This prevents a deeper fall in
Aggregate demand.

During an expansion: unemployment falls, fewer people claim benefits. Government transfer payments
Automatically decrease, reducing household income growth. This prevents excessive overheating.

### Significance

Automatic stabilisers act immediately (no legislative delay), are self-financing (they generate
Surpluses during booms and deficits during recessions), and do not require political negotiation.
They are the first line of defence against economic fluctuations.

## Government Debt and the Crowding-Out Effect

### Government Debt

When the government runs a budget deficit, it must borrow by issuing government bonds. Accumulated
Deficits over time constitute the national debt.

$$\mathrm{Debt}_{t} = \mathrm{Debt}_{t-1} + \mathrm{Deficit}_{t}$$

### Crowding-Out Effect

The crowding-out effect occurs when increased government borrowing to finance a deficit drives up
Interest rates, which reduces private investment.

**Mechanism:**

1. Government runs a deficit and issues bonds to borrow.
2. Increased supply of bonds pushes bond prices down and bond yields (interest rates) up.
3. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for firms.
4. Firms reduce investment spending (fewer projects meet the required rate of return).
5. The increase in government spending is partially or fully offset by a decrease in private
   investment.

$$\mathrm{Full crowding out: } \Delta G = -\Delta I$$

In the extreme case (full crowding out), the increase in government spending is exactly offset by
The decrease in private investment, and aggregate demand does not change at all. The composition of
Output shifts from investment to government spending, which may reduce long-run growth (investment
Drives productivity improvements).

### Factors Affecting the Degree of Crowding Out

| Factor                          | Effect on Crowding Out                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Size of the deficit             | Larger deficit = more borrowing = more crowding out                                                                                                                                     |
| State of the economy            | In a recession with idle resources, crowding out is minimal (the central bank may accommodate). At full employment, crowding out is significant.                                        |
| Central bank response           | If the central bank accommodates (buys bonds to keep rates stable), crowding out is reduced. If not, crowding out is larger.                                                            |
| Openness of the economy         | In a small open economy with mobile capital (like Hong Kong), higher interest rates attract foreign capital inflows, which moderate the rise in domestic rates and reduce crowding out. |
| Elasticity of investment demand | If investment is highly interest-elastic (sensitive to rate changes), crowding out is larger.                                                                                           |
| Source of financing             | If financed by issuing bonds, crowding out occurs. If financed by money creation (monetised), crowding out is avoided but inflation risk increases.                                     |

## Monetary Policy

### Definition

Monetary policy is the central bank's use of interest rates, money supply, and other tools to
Influence aggregate demand, inflation, and economic growth. For a detailed discussion of monetary
Policy tools, see
[../8-money-and-banking/1_money-and-banking](../8-money-and-banking/1_money-and-banking).

### Expansionary Monetary Policy

**Objective:** Stimulate aggregate demand during a recession.

**Instruments:**

| Instrument                     | Mechanism                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lower the policy interest rate | Reduces cost of borrowing for banks; banks lower lending rates; consumers and firms borrow and spend more.                      |
| Lower the reserve ratio        | Banks can lend a larger proportion of deposits; credit creation expands; money supply increases.                                |
| Open market purchases          | Central bank buys government bonds; injects reserves into the banking system; interest rates fall.                              |
| Quantitative easing (QE)       | Central bank buys large quantities of longer-term securities; further lowers long-term interest rates; increases bank reserves. |

### Contractionary Monetary Policy

**Objective:** Reduce aggregate demand to combat inflation.

**Instruments:**

| Instrument                     | Mechanism                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raise the policy interest rate | Increases cost of borrowing; banks raise lending rates; consumers and firms borrow and spend less. |
| Raise the reserve ratio        | Banks must hold more reserves; credit creation contracts; money supply decreases.                  |
| Open market sales              | Central bank sells government bonds; drains reserves from the banking system; interest rates rise. |

### Transmission Mechanism of Monetary Policy

The transmission mechanism describes the chain of cause and effect through which monetary policy
Influences the real economy. This process operates with lags ( 12-18 months for the full Effect to
materialise).

**Step 1: Policy rate change.** The central bank adjusts the base rate / policy rate.

**Step 2: Market interest rates adjust.** Commercial banks adjust their lending and deposit rates in
Response to the policy rate change. Bond yields adjust. The yield curve shifts.

**Step 3: Transmission channels:**

| Channel               | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interest rate channel | Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing for households (mortgages, car loans) and firms (business loans). Consumption and investment increase.                                                               |
| Exchange rate channel | Lower domestic interest rates reduce the attractiveness of domestic assets to foreign investors. Capital flows out. The domestic currency depreciates. Exports become cheaper, imports become more expensive. |
| Asset price channel   | Lower rates increase the present value of future cash flows, raising asset prices (stocks, bonds, property). Higher asset prices increase household wealth, boosting consumption (wealth effect).             |
| Credit channel        | Lower policy rates improve banks' willingness to lend. Firms and households find it easier to obtain credit.                                                                                                  |
| Expectations channel  | Central bank communication about future policy influences expectations. If firms and households expect lower rates to persist, they bring forward spending and investment decisions.                          |

**Step 4: Aggregate demand shifts.** The combined effect of these channels shifts the aggregate
Demand curve (to the right for expansionary policy, to the left for contractionary policy).

**Step 5: Real output and prices adjust.** Higher AD increases real GDP and employment in the short
Run. If the economy is near full employment, higher AD primarily raises prices (inflation).

### Limitations of Monetary Policy

| Limitation                      | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time lags                       | The full effect of a rate change takes 12-18 months. By the time the effect is felt, economic conditions may have changed. |
| Liquidity trap                  | When interest rates are already near zero, further rate cuts may have little effect (zero lower bound).                    |
| Bank lending channel blocked    | If banks are risk-averse, they may not pass on lower rates to borrowers, weakening the transmission mechanism.             |
| Exchange rate constraint        | For countries with fixed exchange rates (like Hong Kong), monetary policy is constrained by the need to maintain the peg.  |
| Unpredictable velocity of money | The relationship between money supply changes and nominal GDP changes may be unstable during financial crises.             |
| Distributional effects          | Lower interest rates boost asset prices (benefiting asset owners) more than wages, potentially exacerbating inequality.    |

## Supply-Side Policies

### Definition

Supply-side policies aim to increase the productive capacity of the economy (shift the LRAS curve to
The right) by improving the quantity, quality, and efficiency of factors of production. Unlike
Demand-side policies (fiscal and monetary policy), supply-side policies address the supply side of
The economy and are the primary tool for achieving long-run economic growth.

### Market-Oriented Supply-Side Policies

These policies rely on market forces and incentives, with minimal government intervention.

| Policy                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deregulation            | Removing unnecessary government regulations that increase business costs and reduce competition. Examples: removing price controls, reducing licensing requirements, simplifying business registration.       |
| Privatisation           | Transferring state-owned enterprises to private ownership. Arguments: private firms face profit incentives and are more efficient. Counter-argument: natural monopolies may need public ownership.            |
| Tax reform              | Reducing marginal tax rates on income and corporate profits to increase incentives to work, save, and invest. Shifting the tax base from income to consumption. Broadening the tax base while lowering rates. |
| Reducing trade barriers | Lowering tariffs, removing quotas, signing free trade agreements. Increases competition, forces domestic firms to improve efficiency.                                                                         |
| Labour market reform    | Making it easier for firms to hire and fire workers, reducing minimum wages, weakening trade union power. Aims to increase labour market flexibility and reduce structural unemployment.                      |
| Encouraging competition | Strengthening anti-trust / competition law to prevent monopolies and cartels. Promoting new firm entry. Reducing barriers to entrepreneurship.                                                                |
| Property rights reform  | Strengthening legal protection of private property rights. Secure property rights encourage investment and long-term planning.                                                                                |

### Interventionist Supply-Side Policies

These policies involve direct government action and spending.

| Policy                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Education and training    | Government investment in education improves human capital. Retraining programmes for unemployed workers reduce structural unemployment.                                                      |
| Infrastructure investment | Government spending on transport, telecommunications, energy, and water infrastructure reduces business costs and increases productivity.                                                    |
| R&D subsidies             | Government grants, tax credits, and direct funding for research and development. Encourages private firms to invest in innovation. Addresses the positive externality of knowledge creation. |

| Healthcare investment     | A healthier workforce is more productive and takes fewer sick days. Government healthcare spending improves human capital.                                                                   |

## Policy Conflicts and Trade-Offs

Macroeconomic policies frequently conflict with one another. Achieving all objectives simultaneously
Is rarely possible, forcing policymakers to make trade-offs.

### Inflation vs Unemployment

The short-run Phillips curve describes an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.
Reducing unemployment below the natural rate requires accepting higher inflation, and reducing
Inflation requires accepting higher unemployment.

**Policy conflict:** Expansionary policy reduces unemployment but risks inflation. Contractionary
Policy reduces inflation but increases unemployment.

### Economic Growth vs Inflation

Rapid economic growth (driven by strong aggregate demand) tends to generate inflationary pressure,
Especially as the economy approaches full capacity. Policymakers must balance the desire for growth
With the need for price stability.

### Economic Growth vs Environment

Economic growth driven by industrial production and consumption often increases pollution, resource
Depletion, and carbon emissions. Supply-side policies that increase productive capacity may also
Increase environmental degradation unless paired with environmental regulation.

**Policy conflict:** Deregulation and reduced trade barriers promote growth but may increase
Pollution. Environmental regulation protects the environment but may increase business costs and
Reduce competitiveness.

### Balance of Payments vs Domestic Objectives

Expansionary monetary policy (lower interest rates) may stimulate domestic growth but can cause
Currency depreciation, which may worsen the trade balance (if the Marshall-Lerner condition is not
Met in the short run) and cause imported inflation.

Contractionary monetary policy (higher interest rates) may reduce inflation but attract capital
Inflows, causing currency appreciation, which may worsen the trade balance (exports become more
Expensive).

### Fiscal Policy vs Monetary Policy

**Conflict:** If the government runs a large deficit (expansionary fiscal policy) while the central
Bank is raising interest rates (contractionary monetary policy), the two policies work at
Cross-purposes. The government's borrowing pushes interest rates up, while the central bank also
Pushes rates up, creating very tight financial conditions.

**Coordination:** Ideally, fiscal and monetary policy should be coordinated. During a recession,
Both should be expansionary. During inflation, both should be contractionary. In practice,
Coordination is complicated by the independence of central banks and political pressures on fiscal
Policy.

### Hong Kong's Policy Constraints

Hong Kong faces unique constraints:

1. **No independent monetary policy:** Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong must follow
   US monetary policy. The HKMA cannot lower interest rates independently during a local recession
   if the US Federal Reserve is raising rates.
2. **Small, open economy:** Hong Kong is extremely trade-dependent. Changes in the global economic
   environment have a disproportionate impact on Hong Kong's economy.
3. **Narrow tax base:** Hong Kong relies heavily on a few revenue sources (land premiums, salaries
   tax, profits tax). This limits the government's ability to use tax policy as a macroeconomic
   stabiliser.

Given these constraints, Hong Kong relies more on automatic stabilisers, land supply management, and
Targeted fiscal measures than on discretionary macroeconomic policy.

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing the spending multiplier with the tax multiplier:** The spending multiplier is larger
   than the tax multiplier (in absolute value). A USD 100 billion increase in government spending
   has a larger effect on GDP than a USD 100 billion tax cut, because some of the tax cut is saved
   rather than spent.

2. **Ignoring leakages in the multiplier:** The simple multiplier formula `1/(1-MPC)` assumes no
   taxes and no imports. In reality, taxes and imports are leakages that reduce the multiplier.
   Using the simple formula for an open economy with taxation overstates the multiplier effect.

3. **Assuming crowding out is always complete:** Crowding out depends on the state of the economy.
   In a deep recession with idle resources and near-zero interest rates, crowding out is minimal. At
   full employment, crowding out is more significant.

4. **Confusing fiscal policy with monetary policy:** Fiscal policy involves government spending and
   taxation (the government's budget). Monetary policy involves the money supply and interest rates
   (the central bank's actions). They are distinct instruments, even though they both affect
   aggregate demand.

5. **Assuming supply-side policies work quickly:** Supply-side policies (education, infrastructure,
   deregulation) take years, sometimes decades, to have their full effect. They are not suitable as
   short-term stabilisation tools. Demand-side policies (fiscal and monetary) are more appropriate
   for short-run stabilisation.

6. **Stating that lower interest rates always stimulate the economy:** If banks are unwilling to
   lend (credit crunch), if businesses are pessimistic about future demand, or if interest rates are
   already near zero (liquidity trap), lower rates may have little effect. The transmission
   mechanism can break down.

7. **Ignoring the time lags in policy:** Fiscal policy has an implementation lag (time to pass
   legislation) and an impact lag (time for spending changes to affect the economy). Monetary policy
   has a shorter implementation lag but a longer impact lag (12-18 months for full effect).

8. **Assuming the balanced budget multiplier is zero:** The balanced budget multiplier is actually
   equal to 1. If the government increases both spending and taxes by the same amount, national
   income still increases. This is because the full amount of the spending increase is injected, but
   only a portion of the tax increase is withdrawn from spending (the rest comes from saving).

9. **Confusing demand-side and supply-side policies:** Demand-side policies (fiscal and monetary)
   shift the AD curve and affect output and prices in the short run. Supply-side policies shift the
   LRAS curve and affect the economy's productive capacity in the long run.

10. **Ignoring the impact of expectations:** If firms and households expect the government's
    policies to be inflationary, they may adjust their behaviour in ways that undermine the policy
    (e.g., demanding higher wages in anticipation of inflation, which triggers cost-push inflation).
    Expectations can be self-fulfilling.

## Practice Problems

</details>
<details>
<summary>Question 1: Multiplier Calculations</summary>

An economy has MPC = 0.75, MPT = 0.1, and MPM = 0.1.

(a) Calculate the multiplier. (b) If the government increases spending by USD 50 billion, what is
The total change in national income? (c) If the government instead cuts taxes by USD 50 billion,
What is the total change in national income? (d) Which policy is more effective? Explain.

(a) Multiplier = 1 / (MPS + MPT + MPM) = 1 / (0.25 + 0.1 + 0.1) = 1 / 0.45 = 2.22

(b) Change in Y = 2.22 x 50 = 111.1 billion

(c) Tax multiplier = -MPC x multiplier = -0.75 x 2.22 = -1.67

Change in Y = -1.67 x (-50) = 83.5 billion

(d) The spending increase is more effective (111.1 vs 83.5 billion) because the full USD 50 billion
Is injected directly into the economy. With a tax cut, only MPC x 50 = 37.5 billion is initially
Spent (the remaining 12.5 billion is saved). The initial injection is smaller, so the total effect
Is smaller.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Question 2: Crowding-Out Analysis</summary>

An economy is at full employment. The government increases spending by USD 80 billion. The MPC is
0.6, and there are no taxes or imports. Assume the interest rate rises enough to fully crowd out
Private investment.

(a) Calculate the simple multiplier. (b) What is the change in national income without crowding out?
(c) With full crowding out, what is the actual change in national income? (d) By how much does
Private investment change?

(a) Simple multiplier = 1 / (1 - 0.6) = 1 / 0.4 = 2.5

(b) Without crowding out: Change in Y = 2.5 x 80 = 200 billion

(c) With full crowding out: The increase in government spending is exactly offset by a decrease in
Private investment. AD does not change, so national income does not change. Change in Y = 0.

(d) Private investment decreases by USD 80 billion. The increase in government borrowing drives
Interest rates up by enough to reduce private investment by exactly the amount of the government
Spending increase.

Note: Full crowding out is a theoretical extreme. In practice, crowding out is partial.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Question 3: Policy Mix</summary>

An economy is experiencing high inflation (8%) and high unemployment (9%). The natural rate of
Unemployment is 5%.

(a) What type of gap does the economy have? (b) Can demand-side policy alone solve both problems?
Explain. (c) What combination of policies would you recommend?

(a) The economy has STAGFLATION: high inflation AND high unemployment. The actual unemployment rate
(9%) exceeds the natural rate (5%), indicating a recessionary gap in output. However, inflation is
Also high (8%), which is inconsistent with a simple recessionary gap. This situation is caused by a
Leftward shift of the SRAS curve (cost-push inflation), not by excess demand.

(b) No, demand-side policy alone cannot solve both problems simultaneously:

- Expansionary fiscal/monetary policy would reduce unemployment but worsen inflation.
- Contractionary fiscal/monetary policy would reduce inflation but worsen unemployment.

This is a policy dilemma because the standard demand management tools move inflation and
Unemployment in opposite directions.

(c) The recommended policy mix is:

- **Contractionary demand-side policy** (higher interest rates, reduced government spending) to
  reduce inflation.
- **Expansionary supply-side policy** (education, retraining, infrastructure investment,
  deregulation, R&D subsidies) to increase productive capacity, reduce structural unemployment, and
  shift the LRAS curve to the right.

Supply-side policies address the root cause of stagflation (a supply shock that reduced productive
Capacity) without the inflationary side effects of demand-side stimulus.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Question 4: Fiscal Policy in Hong Kong</summary>

Hong Kong's government runs a budget surplus of HKD 100 billion. The economy is growing at 2% (real
GDP growth) and inflation is 1.5%.

(a) What type of fiscal policy is this? (b) What effect does this have on aggregate demand? (c) Is
This policy appropriate given the economic conditions? Explain. (d) What are the constraints on Hong
Kong's fiscal policy?

(a) A budget surplus is a **contractionary** fiscal stance (tax revenue exceeds government spending,
Withdrawing net demand from the economy).

(b) The surplus reduces aggregate demand. The government is removing more purchasing power from the
Economy (through taxes) than it is injecting (through spending).

(c) The appropriateness depends on the position of the economy relative to potential output:

- If the economy is at or above potential output, the contractionary stance helps prevent
  overheating and is appropriate.
- If the economy is below potential output (a recessionary gap exists), the contractionary stance
  would worsen the gap and is inappropriate. However, with inflation at 1.5% (below typical targets
  of 2-3%), there may be room for expansionary policy.

With growth at 2% and inflation at 1.5%, the economy appears to be operating below its potential. A
Budget surplus may not be the most appropriate fiscal stance in this context.

(d) Hong Kong's fiscal policy constraints:

- No independent monetary policy limits the ability to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy.
- Narrow tax base (reliance on land premiums, salaries tax, profits tax).
- Small, open economy: fiscal multipliers are smaller because imports are a large leakage.
- Land premium revenue is volatile and cyclical, making budget forecasting difficult.
- Fiscal reserves provide a buffer but are finite.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Question 5: Balanced Budget Multiplier</summary>

The government increases both spending and taxes by USD 60 billion. MPC = 0.8. There are no imports
And no proportional taxes.

(a) Calculate the spending multiplier. (b) Calculate the change in national income from the spending
Increase alone. (c) Calculate the change in national income from the tax increase alone. (d)
Calculate the net change in national income. (e) What is the balanced budget multiplier?

(a) Spending multiplier = 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5

(b) From spending increase: Delta Y = 5 x 60 = 300 billion

(c) Tax multiplier = -MPC x spending multiplier = -0.8 x 5 = -4

From tax increase: Delta Y = -4 x 60 = -240 billion

(d) Net change = 300 + (-240) = 60 billion

(e) Balanced budget multiplier = Net change in Y / Change in G (or T) = 60 / 60 = 1

The balanced budget multiplier is 1. Equal increases in government spending and taxation raise
National income by the same amount as the increase in spending. This is because all of the spending
Increase is injected, but only the portion of the tax increase that would have been consumed (MPC x
Delta T = 48 billion) is withdrawn from spending. The remaining 12 billion of the tax increase would
Have been saved, so its withdrawal does not reduce consumption.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Question 6: Monetary Policy Transmission</summary>

The central bank lowers the base rate by 1 percentage point. Trace the full transmission mechanism
And explain the expected effects on each sector of the economy, assuming the economy is in a
Recession with high unemployment and low inflation.

**Step 1: Policy rate change.** The central bank lowers the base rate by 1 percentage point.

**Step 2: Market interest rates adjust.** Commercial banks lower their prime lending rates, mortgage
Rates, and deposit rates. Bond yields fall as existing bonds with higher coupon rates become more
Valuable, pushing up their prices and lowering yields.

**Step 3: Transmission channels operate:**

Interest rate channel: Lower mortgage rates reduce monthly housing costs for variable-rate
Borrowers, increasing disposable income. Lower business loan rates reduce the cost of financing
Investment projects. Firms with viable projects that were previously marginal (expected return just
Below the old borrowing cost) now find them profitable and proceed. Consumption of big-ticket
Durables (cars, appliances) financed by credit increases.

Exchange rate channel: Lower domestic interest rates reduce the attractiveness of domestic assets to
Foreign investors. Capital flows out, depreciating the domestic currency. Export goods become
Cheaper for foreign buyers (boosting export volumes and revenue). Import goods become more expensive
For domestic consumers (reducing import volumes). Net exports increase, further stimulating
Aggregate demand.

Asset price channel: Lower discount rates increase the present value of future cash flows. Stock
Prices rise. Bond prices rise. Property prices rise. Household wealth increases, and the wealth
Effect boosts consumption (homeowners feel wealthier and spend more). The lower cost of equity
Financing encourages firms to raise capital by issuing shares.

Credit channel: Banks' funding costs fall, improving their willingness to extend credit. Lending
Standards may be relaxed. Firms and households that were previously credit-constrained gain access
To borrowing.

Expectations channel: The rate cut signals that the central bank is committed to supporting the
Economy. Business confidence improves. Firms may bring forward investment plans that they had
Postponed. Consumers expecting economic recovery may increase spending rather than precautionary
Saving.

**Step 4: Aggregate demand shifts right.** Consumption, investment, and net exports all increase. AD
Shifts right.

**Step 5: Real output and prices adjust.** With the economy in recession (output below potential),
The increase in AD primarily raises real GDP and employment. The output gap narrows. Inflation may
Rise slightly but remains below target due to the large output gap. The economy moves toward full
Employment without generating significant inflationary pressure.

<details>
<summary>Question 7: Supply-Side Policy Evaluation</summary>

An economy has the following characteristics: high structural unemployment (6%), low productivity
Growth (0.5% per year), declining competitiveness in manufacturing, and an ageing population.

Evaluate the effectiveness of market-oriented and interventionist supply-side policies for
Addressing each of these problems.

**Structural unemployment (6%):**

Market-oriented: Labour market deregulation (reducing employment protection legislation, minimum
Wage reform) may increase hiring flexibility but risks reducing job security and worker welfare.
Reducing unemployment benefits may increase the incentive to search for work but pushes some
Unemployed into poverty.

Interventionist: Government-funded retraining programmes directly address the skills mismatch.
Education reform (emphasising STEM, vocational training) improves the long-term skills base.
Regional policy (incentives for firms to locate in high-unemployment areas) addresses geographic
Mismatch.

**Low productivity growth (0.5% per year):**

Market-oriented: Tax incentives for R&D encourage private innovation. Privatisation of inefficient
State-owned enterprises forces productivity improvements through competition. Reducing trade
Barriers exposes domestic firms to international competition, compelling efficiency gains.

Interventionist: Government funding for basic research (which has large positive externalities that
Private firms under-invest in). Infrastructure investment (broadband, transport, energy) reduces
Business costs and raises productivity. Industrial policy targeting high-productivity sectors.

**Declining manufacturing competitiveness:**

Market-oriented: Free trade agreements reduce input costs and open export markets. Currency
Flexibility allows exchange rate adjustment. Reducing corporate tax rates improves after-tax returns
On investment.

Interventionist: Targeted subsidies for advanced manufacturing. Special economic zones with tax
Breaks and streamlined regulation. Government-backed loans for manufacturing firms investing in
Automation and technology upgrading.

**Ageing population:**

Market-oriented: Raising the retirement age keeps older workers in the labour force. Immigration
Reform to attract young, skilled workers. Tax incentives for private pension savings reduces future
Fiscal burden.

Interventionist: Healthcare investment to extend healthy working years. Lifelong learning programmes
To retrain older workers. Family-friendly policies (childcare subsidies, parental leave) to increase
The birth rate over the long term (though this is a very slow policy).

### Limitations of Supply-Side Policies

1. **Time lags:** Supply-side policies take years to have their full effect. Education reform today
   does not improve the skills of the workforce for a decade or more. Infrastructure projects take
   years to plan, approve, and build. They cannot address short-term recessions.
2. **Cost:** Interventionist supply-side policies require significant government spending, which may
   increase the budget deficit or require higher taxes (which themselves create distortions).
3. **Uncertainty:** The effects of deregulation, tax reform, and education investment are uncertain.
   It is difficult to predict exactly how much LRAS will shift.
4. **Distributional effects:** Market-oriented supply-side policies (deregulation, labour market
   reform) may increase inequality by reducing worker protections and wage bargaining power.
5. **Political resistance:** Supply-side reforms often face opposition from groups that lose out
   (workers facing reduced job security, firms in protected industries, bureaucrats whose
   departments are privatised).
6. **May not address demand deficiencies:** If the economy is in recession due to insufficient
   aggregate demand, supply-side policies alone will not restore full employment. Supply-side
   policies increase potential output but do not directly stimulate demand.

### Fiscal Policy in Hong Kong: Special Considerations

Hong Kong's fiscal policy operates under unique institutional constraints that differ from
Conventional macroeconomic frameworks:

1. **No independent monetary policy:** Because Hong Kong operates the Linked Exchange Rate System
   (pegged to the USD), monetary policy is imported from the US. Fiscal policy bears a heavier
   burden for macroeconomic stabilisation than in economies with independent monetary policy.
2. **Currency board system:** Hong Kong does not have a conventional central bank that can monetise
   fiscal deficits. Government borrowing must come from the market (issuing bonds) or from fiscal
   reserves, not from money creation.
3. **Large fiscal reserves:** Hong Kong has accumulated substantial fiscal reserves (equivalent to
   approximately 12 months of government expenditure). These reserves provide a buffer against
   economic downturns but also raise questions about whether the government is over-saving
   (under-spending on social needs and infrastructure).
4. **Volatile revenue base:** Hong Kong's government revenue is heavily dependent on land premiums
   (revenue from land sales), which are cyclical and unpredictable. During property market
   downturns, land revenue falls sharply, creating budget deficits even without changes in
   expenditure policy.
5. **Simple and low tax system:** Hong Kong has no sales tax or VAT, no capital gains tax, and no
   dividend tax. The narrow tax base limits the government's ability to use tax policy as a
   counter-cyclical stabiliser. Salaries tax and profits tax are the main revenue sources, and both
   are relatively low by international standards.

Despite these constraints, Hong Kong's government has used fiscal policy counter-cyclically, notably
During the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis (economic stimulus packages), the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic
(consumption vouchers, wage subsidies under the Anti-epidemic Fund), and the 2019 social unrest. The
Consumption Voucher Scheme distributed HKD 10,000 to each permanent resident to stimulate domestic
Consumption during the pandemic-induced recession.

what Is the total change in national income? (c) If the government cuts taxes by USD 40 billion,
what is the Total change? (d) Why is the spending increase more effective?

### Details

(a) Multiplier = `1/(MPS + MPT + MPM) = 1/(0.3 + 0.15 + 0.15) = 1/0.6 = 1.67`.

(b) `Delta Y = 1.67 \times 40 = 66.7` billion.

(c) Tax multiplier = `-MPC \times k = -0.7 \times 1.67 = -1.17`.
`Delta Y = -1.17 \times (-40) = 46.7` billion.

(d) The full USD 40 billion is injected directly. With a tax cut, only `0.7 \times 40 = 28` billion

Income? (c) What is the balanced budget multiplier?

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) Multiplier = `1/(0.25 + 0.05 + 0.1) = 1/0.4 = 2.5`. Tax multiplier =

(b) From spending: `2.5 \times 100 = 250`. From taxes: `-1.875 \times 100 = -187.5`. Net change =
`250 - 187.5 = 62.5` billion.

(c) Balanced budget multiplier = `62.5 / 100 = 0.625`. (Note: the balanced budget multiplier equals

The government runs a deficit of USD 60 billion in a small open economy. The MPC is 0.8.

(a) Calculate the simple multiplier and the potential increase in GDP without crowding out. (b) If
Crowding out reduces private investment by USD 30 billion, what is the actual increase in GDP? (c)
Why Might crowding out be less severe in a small open economy?

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) Simple multiplier = `1/(1-0.8) = 5`. Potential GDP increase = `5 \times 60 = 300` billion.

(b) The crowding out of USD 30 billion in investment has a multiplier effect: `5 \times 30 = 150`
Billion reduction. Actual GDP increase = `300 - 150 = 150` billion. (This is partial crowding out.)

(c) In a small open economy with mobile capital (like Hong Kong), higher interest rates attract
foreign Capital inflows, which moderate the rise in domestic interest rates and reduce crowding out.

(a) What type of macroeconomic problem is this? (b) Can demand-side policy solve it alone? (c) What
Policy mix would you recommend?

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) **Stagflation** -- simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment. This is caused by a
leftward Shift of SRAS (cost-push shock), not excess demand.

(b) No. Expansionary policy would reduce unemployment but worsen inflation. Contractionary policy
would Reduce inflation but worsen unemployment. Demand-side tools cannot solve both simultaneously.

(c) **Contractionary demand-side policy** (to reduce inflation) combined with **expansionary
supply-side Policy** (education, retraining, deregulation, infrastructure, R&D) to increase
productive capacity and Reduce structural unemployment. Supply-side policies shift LRAS right,
reducing both inflation and Unemployment.

<summary>Problem 5: Automatic Stabilisers</summary>

During a recession, GDP falls by USD 200 billion. The economy has a progressive tax system with an
Average tax rate of 20% and unemployment benefits that automatically increase by USD 0.30 for every
USD 1 of GDP lost.

(a) By how much do tax revenues automatically fall? (b) By how much do unemployment benefits
Automatically increase? (c) What is the total automatic stabilisation effect?

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) Tax revenue fall = `0.20 \times 200 = 40` billion. This leaves more disposable income in the
Economy than would occur under a lump-sum tax.

(b) Benefit increase = `0.30 \times 200 = 60` billion. This supports household incomes during the
Downturn.

(c) Total automatic stabilisation = `40 + 60 = 100` billion. This is equivalent to an automatic

(c) Increases after-tax returns on investment, encouraging firms to expand and hire more workers.
May Take time to translate into jobs. Effectiveness depends on whether firms invest domestically.
Good for Both structural and cyclical unemployment in the medium term.

(d) Increases competitive pressure on domestic firms, forcing them to become more efficient. May

Government use fiscal policy to offset the contractionary monetary effect?

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) The HKMA must raise Hong Kong interest rates to maintain the linked exchange rate. Otherwise,
capital Would flow from HKD to USD assets, putting downward pressure on the HKD.

(b) Higher interest rates reduce borrowing and spending, further slowing an already weak economy.
Property Prices face downward pressure. Exports become more expensive. The economy may enter a
recession.

(c) Yes. Since Hong Kong lacks independent monetary policy, fiscal policy becomes the primary
Stabilisation tool. The government could increase spending (infrastructure, consumption vouchers) or
Cut taxes to stimulate aggregate demand. Fiscal reserves provide the capacity for expansionary
fiscal Policy.

Government is increasing spending to reduce unemployment.

(a) Describe the conflict between these two policies. (b) What are the likely effects on interest
Rates, investment, and inflation? (c) What would you advise?

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) The central bank's contractionary policy raises interest rates to reduce AD and inflation. The
Government's expansionary fiscal policy increases AD, raising output and inflation. These work at
Cross-purposes. The government's borrowing also pushes interest rates higher, amplifying the central
Bank's tightening.

(b) Interest rates rise more than the central bank intended (due to both central bank action and
Government borrowing). Investment is squeezed from both sides (higher rates from monetary policy and
Crowding out from fiscal policy). The net effect on inflation is ambiguous -- on which Policy is
stronger.

(c) The policies should be coordinated. If inflation is the primary concern, fiscal policy should
also Be contractionary (reduce spending, raise taxes). If reducing unemployment is the priority,
monetary Policy should be expansionary. Mixed signals create uncertainty and undermine both
policies.

## Extended Problem Set: Advanced Fiscal and Monetary Policy

### Problem 9: Balanced Budget Multiplier

The government increases both spending and taxes by HK$100 billion simultaneously. The MPC is 0.75.

(a) Calculate the change in equilibrium GDP from the spending increase alone. (b) Calculate the
change in equilibrium GDP from the tax increase alone. (c) Calculate the net change in GDP. What is
the balanced budget multiplier?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) Spending multiplier $= \frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = 4$. Change from spending
$= 4 \times 100 = \text{HK}\$400$ billion.

(b) Tax multiplier $= \frac{-0.75}{1 - 0.75} = -3$. Change from tax
$= -3 \times 100 = -\text{HK}\$300$ billion.

(c) Net change $= 400 - 300 = \text{HK}\$100$ billion.

The balanced budget multiplier $= 1$. Equal increases in government spending and taxation increase
GDP by exactly the amount of the increase. This is because the spending injection is fully absorbed
by the economy, while the tax increase only reduces consumption by the MPC fraction.

### Problem 10: Crowding Out with a Loanable Funds Model

An economy has national saving $S = 200 + 5r$ (where $r$ is the real interest rate in %) and planned
investment $I = 500 - 10r$. The government initially has a balanced budget ($G = T$). It then
increases spending by HK$80 billion, financing it entirely by borrowing (no tax change).

(a) Calculate the initial equilibrium interest rate and investment. (b) Calculate the new
equilibrium interest rate and investment after the spending increase. (c) Calculate the amount of
crowding out. (d) Explain why complete crowding out would occur if saving is perfectly
interest-inelastic.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) Initial: $S = I$. $200 + 5r = 500 - 10r$. $15r = 300$. $r = 20\%$. $I = 500 - 10(20) = 300$.

(b) Government borrowing of 80 reduces national saving by 80 at every interest rate. New saving:
$S' = 200 + 5r - 80 = 120 + 5r$.

$S' = I$: $120 + 5r = 500 - 10r$. $15r = 380$. $r = 25.33\%$. $I' = 500 - 10(25.33) = 246.7$.

(c) Crowding out $= I - I' = 300 - 246.7 = \text{HK}\$53.3$ billion.

The
HK$80 billion in government spending crowds out HK$53.3 billion in private investment. The net increase in aggregate demand $= 80 - 53.3 = 26.7$
billion.

(d) If saving is perfectly interest-inelastic ($S$ does not respond to $r$), then any government
borrowing reduces the pool of loanable funds available for private investment by exactly the amount
borrowed. The interest rate rises until investment falls by the full amount of the government
borrowing. In this case, the fiscal multiplier is zero: government spending completely crowds out
private spending.

### Problem 11: Fiscal Policy in Hong Kong Under the Currency Board

Hong Kong's government increases infrastructure spending by HK$50 billion during a recession. The
HKD is pegged at 7.8 to the USD. The MPC is 0.7, the marginal propensity to import is 0.35, and
there is no income tax.

(a) Calculate the fiscal multiplier. (b) Calculate the change in equilibrium GDP. (c) Explain why
the multiplier may be smaller in Hong Kong than in a larger, less open economy. (d) If the US
Federal Reserve simultaneously raises interest rates, explain the interaction effect on Hong Kong's
economy.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) With imports (and no tax): multiplier
$= \frac{1}{1 - MPC + MPM} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.70 + 0.35} = \frac{1}{0.65} = 1.538$.

(b) $\Delta GDP = 1.538 \times 50 = \text{HK}\$76.9$ billion.

(c) Hong Kong's multiplier (1.538) is much smaller than a closed economy's multiplier
($\frac{1}{1-0.7} = 3.33$). This is because Hong Kong is extremely open: the MPM of 0.35 means 35
cents of every additional dollar of income leaks out as imports. This "import leakage" significantly
dampens the multiplier effect. Additionally, Hong Kong's small size means supply constraints may
limit the output response (especially in the construction sector for infrastructure projects).

(d) If the Fed raises rates simultaneously, the HKMA must follow to maintain the peg. Higher Hong
Kong interest rates would:

- Raise the cost of borrowing for the infrastructure projects (the government and its contractors
  face higher financing costs).
- Reduce private consumption and investment, partially offsetting the fiscal expansion.
- Appreciate the HKD within the Convertibility Zone, reducing net exports.

The net effect is ambiguous: the fiscal expansion stimulates the economy while the monetary
contraction (imported from the Fed) dampens it. The fiscal multiplier would be smaller than the
1.538 calculated above because the interest rate increase introduces additional crowding out.

### Problem 12: Quantitative Easing and the Money Supply

The HKMA conducts open market operations, purchasing HK$30 billion of Exchange Fund Bills from
commercial banks. The required reserve ratio is 5%. Banks hold 3% of deposits as excess reserves,
and the public's currency-deposit ratio is 10%.

(a) Calculate the money multiplier. (b) Calculate the maximum change in the broad money supply. (c)
If banks decide to hold 8% excess reserves (a conservative posture during uncertainty), recalculate
the money multiplier and the change in broad money. (d) Explain why QE may be less effective during
a financial crisis.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) Money multiplier with excess reserves and currency drain:

$$m = \frac{1 + cr}{rrr + er + cr} = \frac{1 + 0.10}{0.05 + 0.03 + 0.10} = \frac{1.10}{0.18} = 6.11$$

(b) $\Delta M = m \times \Delta B = 6.11 \times 30 = \text{HK}\$183.3$ billion.

(c) With $er = 0.08$:

$$m = \frac{1.10}{0.05 + 0.08 + 0.10} = \frac{1.10}{0.23} = 4.78$$

$\Delta M = 4.78 \times 30 = \text{HK}\$143.5$ billion.

The increase in excess reserves from 3% to 8% reduces the money multiplier from 6.11 to 4.78 and the
broad money expansion from HK$183.3B to HK$143.5B -- a reduction of HK$39.8 billion. This
demonstrates how banks' risk appetite affects the transmission of monetary policy.

(d) During a financial crisis:

1. Banks become risk-averse and hold large excess reserves rather than lending them out.
2. Borrowers (firms and households) are pessimistic about the future and reduce borrowing even at
   low rates.
3. The velocity of money may fall (people hoard cash), offsetting the increase in money supply.
4. Asset prices may be depressed, reducing collateral values and further constraining lending.
5. The normal interest rate channel may be exhausted (zero lower bound), forcing reliance on QE
   which works primarily through portfolio rebalancing and signalling effects.

### Problem 13: AD-AS Model with Supply Shocks

An economy is in long-run equilibrium at $P = 100$, $Y = 1000$ (potential output). An adverse supply
shock (e.g., an oil price increase) shifts the SRAS leftward by 5% at every price level. The SRAS is
relatively flat: a 1% increase in output above potential raises prices by 0.5%. The government has
MPC $= 0.8$ and the central bank follows a strict inflation target of 2%.

(a) Calculate the short-run effect on output and price level. (b) If the government uses fiscal
policy to restore output to potential, what is the cost in terms of inflation? (c) If the central
bank tightens monetary policy to control inflation, what is the cost in terms of output? (d) Explain
the concept of stagflation and why it presents a policy dilemma.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) The SRAS shift reduces output by approximately 5% and raises prices. New short-run equilibrium:
$Y_{SR} = 950$, $P_{SR} = 100 + 0.5 \times 50 = 125$ (using the given Phillips curve relationship).

More precisely, the adverse supply shock shifts SRAS left. At the original price level
$P = 100$Firms now produce 5% less: $Y = 950$. The resulting excess demand pushes prices up along
the new SRAS until a new short-run equilibrium is reached. Output falls below potential and prices
rise -- this is stagflation.

(b) To restore $Y = 1000$ through fiscal policy, the government must shift AD rightward. The
required AD shift depends on the SRAS slope. With a relatively flat SRAS, a moderate AD shift
restores output but causes significant inflation (prices rise above 125).

(c) To control inflation back to 2% (price level target $= 100 \times 1.02 = 102$), the central bank
must reduce AD. This requires raising interest rates, which reduces investment and consumption.
Output falls further below 950, creating a deeper recession.

(d) Stagflation -- simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment (output below potential) --
presents a policy dilemma because demand-side policies cannot solve both problems simultaneously:

- Expansionary policy (increase AD) reduces unemployment but worsens inflation.
- Contractionary policy (reduce AD) reduces inflation but worsens unemployment.

The only way to resolve stagflation is through supply-side policies that shift SRAS rightward (e.g.,
reducing oil dependency, improving technology, deregulating markets) or by waiting for the supply
shock to dissipate (e.g., oil prices falling back).

## Additional Problems: Fiscal Policy and Monetary Policy Integration

### Problem 14: Government Debt Sustainability

Country G has debt-to-GDP ratio of 90%, nominal GDP growth of 5%, nominal interest rate on debt of
4%, and a primary deficit of 2% of GDP.

(a) Using the debt dynamics equation, determine whether the debt ratio is rising or falling. (b)
Calculate the primary balance required to stabilise the debt ratio at 90%. (c) If the government
reduces the primary deficit to zero, how long will it take for the debt ratio to fall to 60%? (d)
Apply this analysis to Japan (debt/GDP > 250%) and explain why Japan has not faced a debt crisis.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a)
$\Delta d \approx (r - g) \times d + p = (0.04 - 0.05) \times 0.90 + 0.02 = -0.009 + 0.02 = 0.011$.

The debt ratio is **rising** by 1.1 percentage points per year. Despite the favourable
interest-growth differential ($g > r$), the primary deficit drives the ratio upward.

(b) For stabilisation: $\Delta d = 0$. $(r - g) \times d + p = 0$.
$p = -(r - g) \times d = -(-0.01) \times 0.90 = 0.009 = 0.9\%$.

The government needs a primary surplus of 0.9% of GDP (or a primary deficit no larger than 0.9%).

(c) With primary balance = 0: $\Delta d = (r - g) \times d = -0.01d$.

This is a differential equation: $\frac{dd}{dt} = -0.01d$. Solution:
$d(t) = 0.90 \times e^{-0.01t}$.

Set $d(t) = 0.60$: $0.60 = 0.90 \times e^{-0.01t}$. $e^{-0.01t} = 0.667$.
$-0.01t = \ln(0.667) = -0.405$. $t = 40.5$ years.

It takes approximately 40.5 years for the debt ratio to fall from 90% to 60% with a balanced primary
budget. This illustrates that debt reduction is a very slow process.

(d) **Japan's situation:** Japan has a debt/GDP ratio exceeding 250%, far above the 90% threshold
often cited as dangerous. Yet Japan has not faced a debt crisis because:

1. **Most debt is domestically held:** Over 90% of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are held by
   Japanese institutions (banks, insurance companies, the Bank of Japan). There is no dependence on
   foreign investors who could suddenly withdraw.
2. **Low interest rates:** The Bank of Japan's yield curve control policy keeps JGB yields near
   zero. Even with a debt/GDP of 250%, the interest burden is only about 1% of GDP
   ($0.25 \times 0.004 = 0.001$Assuming a 0.4% yield).
3. **Current account surplus:** Japan runs a persistent current account surplus, meaning it is a net
   creditor to the world. The government can always borrow from its own citizens' savings.
4. **High domestic savings rate:** Japan's aging population saves heavily, providing a ready source
   of government financing.

**Risk:** Japan's situation is sustainable as long as domestic investors continue to buy JGBs at low
yields. If inflation rises (forcing the BoJ to raise rates) or if the aging population dissaves
(reducing domestic savings), the dynamics could change rapidly.

### Problem 15: Supply-Side Policy Evaluation

An economy faces the following problems: potential GDP growth has fallen from 3% to 1.5% over the
past decade, productivity growth is stagnant, and youth unemployment is 15%.

The government proposes: (i) reduce corporate tax from 20% to 15%, (ii) increase public investment
in infrastructure by 1% of GDP, (iii) introduce apprenticeship programmes for vocational training.

(a) Explain how each policy affects aggregate supply (both short-run and long-run). (b) Calculate
the fiscal cost of the corporate tax cut if corporate tax revenue is currently 4% of GDP and GDP is
USD 2,000 billion. Use a tax elasticity of 0.4. (c) Calculate the long-run GDP impact if the
infrastructure investment has a fiscal multiplier of 1.5 and also increases potential GDP by 0.3%
per year. (d) Critically evaluate supply-side policies as a solution to secular stagnation.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) (i) **Corporate tax cut:** Reduces the cost of capital, encouraging investment. In the SRAS,
lower costs shift SRAS right (lower prices, higher output). In the long run, higher investment
increases the capital stock, shifting LRAS right (higher potential GDP).

(ii) **Infrastructure investment:** Increases AD in the short run (government spending). Also
increases AS by improving productivity (better transport reduces logistics costs, reliable power
reduces production disruptions). The supply-side effect shifts both SRAS and LRAS right.

(iii) **Apprenticeship programmes:** Reduces structural unemployment by improving the match between
workers' skills and employer needs. Shifts LRAS right by increasing the effective labour supply
(more workers with relevant skills).

(b) Current corporate tax revenue $= 0.04 \times 2000 = \text{USD } 80$ billion.

With a 5 percentage point cut (from 20% to 15%, a 25% reduction in the rate): the tax base expands
due to the lower rate. Using a tax elasticity of 0.4 (the tax base expands by 0.4% for every 1%
reduction in the rate):

Base expansion $= 0.4 \times 25\% = 10\%$. New tax base $= 1.10 \times$ original base.

New revenue $= 0.15 \times 1.10 \times \text{original base} = 0.165 \times \text{original base}$.

Original base $= 80 / 0.20 = 400$ billion. New revenue $= 0.165 \times 400 = 66$ billion.

Fiscal cost $= 80 - 66 = \text{USD } 14$ billion (0.7% of GDP). The Laffer curve effect recovers 30%
of the static revenue loss.

(c) **Short-run demand effect:** $\Delta Y = 1.5 \times 20 = \text{USD } 30$ billion (1.5% of GDP).

**Long-run supply effect:** 0.3% higher potential GDP per year from infrastructure. After 10 years,
cumulative supply boost $= (1.003^{10} - 1) \times 2000 = 0.034 \times 2000 = \text{USD } 61$
billion (3% above baseline).

Total effect after 10 years: demand effect (one-time) + supply effect (cumulative)
$= 30 + 61 = \text{USD } 91$ billion increase in GDP.

(d) **Evaluation of supply-side policies for secular stagnation:**

_Strengths:_

- Supply-side policies address the root cause of slow growth (low productivity, low investment)
  rather than treating symptoms (low demand).
- Infrastructure investment has both demand and supply effects, providing a "double dividend."
- Unlike demand stimulus, supply-side policies do not create inflationary pressure.

_Limitations:_

- Supply-side policies have long implementation lags (infrastructure takes 5--15 years, education
  reforms take a generation).
- The effectiveness of tax cuts in stimulating investment depends on business confidence and the
  availability of profitable investment opportunities (which may be lacking during secular
  stagnation).
- Supply-side policies cannot address demand shortfalls in the short run. A comprehensive approach
  combines supply-side reform with demand management.
- "Secular stagnation" (a persistent shortfall of aggregate demand due to demographic headwinds,
  inequality, and low natural interest rates) may require structural demand-side policies (fiscal
  expansion, redistribution) in addition to supply-side reforms.
