## Fiscal and Monetary Policy — Diagnostic Tests

## Unit Tests

### UT-1: Fiscal Multiplier Calculation

**Question:** An economy with MPC $= 0.8$ is in recession with a $\$200$ billion output gap. The
government increases spending by $\$50$ billion. (a) Calculate the spending multiplier. (b)
Calculate the change in equilibrium output. (c) Is this sufficient to close the output gap? (d) If
the government instead cuts taxes by $\$50$ billion, calculate the change in output and explain why
it differs from the spending increase.

**Solution:**

(a) Spending multiplier $= \frac{1}{1 - MPC} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \frac{1}{0.2} = 5$.

(b) Change in output $= 5 \times 50 = \$250$ billion.

(c) Yes, the $\$250$ billion increase exceeds the $\$200$ billion output gap. However, in practice,
the full multiplier effect may not materialise due to crowding out, time lags, and leakages
(imports, savings).

(d) Tax multiplier $= \frac{-MPC}{1 - MPC} = \frac{-0.8}{0.2} = -4$.

Change in output from $\$50$B tax cut $= |-4| \times 50 = \$200$ billion.

The tax cut produces a smaller effect ($\$200$B vs $\$250$B) because households save a portion of
the tax cut (the MPS $= 0.2$). Only the portion spent (MPC $= 0.8$) enters the circular flow. Direct
government spending injects the full amount into the economy immediately.

### UT-2: Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism

**Question:** The central bank raises the base interest rate from 2% to 4%. (a) Explain the
transmission mechanism through which this affects aggregate demand, identifying at least three
channels. (b) If the money multiplier is 5 and the central bank wants to reduce the money supply by
$\$100$ billion through open market operations, how much in government bonds should it sell? (c)
Explain why monetary policy may be less effective during a deep recession (liquidity trap).

**Solution:**

(a) Three channels of monetary policy transmission:

1. **Interest rate channel**: Higher base rates increase commercial bank lending rates. This raises
   the cost of borrowing for firms (reducing investment) and consumers (reducing consumption of
   durables and housing). Higher rates also increase the return on saving, discouraging spending.
2. **Exchange rate channel**: Higher domestic interest rates attract foreign capital inflows,
   increasing demand for the domestic currency and causing appreciation. A stronger currency makes
   exports more expensive and imports cheaper, reducing net exports.
3. **Asset price channel**: Higher interest rates reduce the present value of future cash flows,
   lowering asset prices (stocks, bonds, property). The resulting decline in household wealth
   reduces consumption through the wealth effect.

(b) Change in money supply $= Money multiplier \times Change in monetary base$.
$\Delta M = m \times \Delta B$. $100 = 5 \times \Delta B$ So $\Delta B = \$20$ billion.

The central bank should sell $\$20$ billion of government bonds, reducing bank reserves by $\$20$
billion, which contracts the money supply by $\$100$ billion through the money multiplier.

(c) In a deep recession (liquidity trap), interest rates may already be near zero and cannot be
lowered further (zero lower bound). Even if the central bank increases the money supply, banks may
be unwilling to lend (due to risk aversion) and consumers/firms may be unwilling to borrow (due to
pessimistic expectations). The extra money may be held as idle balances rather than spent, making
monetary policy ineffective. Keynes argued that in this situation, fiscal policy is more reliable
because it directly injects spending into the economy regardless of interest rate conditions.

### UT-3: Fiscal Policy Tools and Budget Balance

**Question:** An economy has the following data: GDP $= \$5000$B, Tax revenue $= \$1000$B,
Government spending $= \$1200$B, Interest payments on debt $= \$150$B. The marginal propensity to
import is 0.2 and MPC $= 0.75$. (a) Calculate the budget balance and the primary balance. (b)
Calculate the full fiscal multiplier accounting for imports. (c) The government wants to achieve a
balanced budget by cutting spending. Calculate the required spending cut and its effect on GDP. (d)
Explain the paradox of thrift/austerity in this context.

**Solution:**

(a) Budget balance $= T - G = 1000 - 1200 = -\$200$B (budget deficit). Primary balance
$= T - G + Interest payments = 1000 - 1200 + 150 = -\$50$B (primary deficit).

(b) With imports, the multiplier includes the marginal propensity to import (MPM): multiplier
$= \frac{1}{1 - MPC + MPM} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.75 + 0.2} = \frac{1}{0.45} = 2.22$.

(c) To balance the budget: spending must be cut by $\$200$B to $\$1000$B. Effect on GDP:
$\Delta Y = 2.22 \times (-200) = -\$444.4$B. New GDP $= 5000 - 444.4 = \$4555.6$B.

(d) The paradox of austerity: cutting spending to balance the budget actually reduces GDP
significantly (-\$444.4B). The recession reduces tax revenue (as incomes fall), which may partially
offset the spending cuts, making it harder to achieve the target deficit reduction. A self-defeating
austerity cycle can occur: spending cuts reduce growth, lower growth reduces tax revenue, requiring
further cuts. This is why many economists argue that during a recession, temporary deficit spending
can be more effective at reducing debt-to-GDP ratios than austerity, because the resulting growth
increases the denominator (GDP) faster than the debt grows.

## Integration Tests

### IT-1: Policy Mix and AD-AS Analysis (with National Income)

**Question:** An economy has GDP $= \$800$B, potential GDP $= \$900$B, inflation $= 6\%$Unemployment
$= 9\%$. The government decides to use a combination of fiscal and monetary policy. (a) Calculate
the output gap and identify the type of gap. (b) The government increases spending by $\$15$B
(multiplier $= 2.5$) and the central bank simultaneously lowers interest rates to stimulate $\$20$B
of additional investment. Calculate the total impact on GDP. (c) What risk does this combined
expansionary approach create for inflation? (d) Explain how the policy mix could be designed to
close the output gap while controlling inflation.

**Solution:**

(a) Output gap $= 800 - 900 = -\$100$B (recessionary gap of 11.1%).

(b) Fiscal impact $= 2.5 \times 15 = \$37.5$B increase. Monetary impact (direct) $= \$20$B increase
in investment. The investment increase also has a multiplier effect: $2.5 \times 20 = \$50$B. Total
increase $= 37.5 + 50 = \$87.5$B. New GDP $= 800 + 87.5 = \$887.5$B (close to but not fully closing
the gap).

(c) The combined expansionary policy risks overheating the economy. With inflation already at 6%,
increasing aggregate demand further could push prices up significantly. The Phillips curve suggests
a trade-off between unemployment and inflation in the short run -- reducing unemployment may come at
the cost of higher inflation.

(d) A better approach might be a **balanced policy mix**: use moderately expansionary fiscal policy
(targeted spending on infrastructure with high multiplier effects and long-term supply-side
benefits) combined with a **neutral or slightly accommodative** monetary policy. This way, fiscal
policy closes the output gap while monetary policy prevents inflation from spiralling.
Alternatively, the government could focus on **supply-side policies** (reducing regulation,
improving education, investing in technology) that increase potential GDP (shift LRAS right) without
increasing inflationary pressure.

### IT-2: Government Debt Dynamics (with International Trade)

**Question:** A country has national debt of $\$3000$B, GDP of $\$5000$B, interest rate on debt of
4%, GDP growth rate of 2%, primary deficit of $\$50$B. (a) Calculate the debt-to-GDP ratio. (b)
Using the debt dynamics equation, determine whether the debt ratio is rising or falling. (c) If the
country runs a current account deficit of 3% of GDP, explain the connection between the twin
deficits. (d) The government proposes cutting the primary deficit to zero. Calculate the new debt
dynamics.

**Solution:**

(a) Debt-to-GDP ratio $= 3000/5000 = 60\%$.

(b) Debt dynamics: the change in debt-to-GDP ratio depends on:
$\Delta d \approx primary deficit/Y + (r - g) \times d$Where $r = 4\%$$g = 2\%$$d = 0.6$.

$\Delta d = 50/5000 + (0.04 - 0.02) \times 0.6 = 0.01 + 0.012 = 0.022$.

The debt ratio is **rising** by approximately 2.2 percentage points per year. The interest-growth
differential $(r - g) = 2\%$ adds to the debt burden, and the primary deficit contributes another
1%.

(c) The **twin deficits hypothesis** states that a fiscal deficit (government borrowing) increases
aggregate demand, which increases imports and reduces net exports, creating a current account
deficit. Mathematically: $(S - I) + (T - G) = (X - M)$. If $G \gt T$ (fiscal deficit) and $S - I$
does not change, then $X - M$ must decrease (current account deficit). The country needs foreign
capital inflows to finance both its fiscal deficit and current account deficit, increasing its
external vulnerability.

(d) With primary deficit $= 0$: $\Delta d = 0 + (0.04 - 0.02) \times 0.6 = 0.012$. The debt ratio is
still rising by 1.2 percentage points per year because the interest rate exceeds the growth rate. To
stabilise the debt ratio, the government needs a primary **surplus** of at least
$(r - g) \times d \times Y = 0.02 \times 0.6 \times 5000 = \$60$B.

### IT-3: Supply-Side Policy Effectiveness (with Market Failure)

**Question:** An economy faces simultaneous problems: stagnant growth (GDP growth $= 1\%$), high
inflation (5%), and high structural unemployment (7%). (a) Explain why demand-side policies alone
are insufficient. (b) The government implements: (i) reduction in corporate tax from 20% to 15%,
(ii) increased spending on vocational training, (iii) deregulation of the labour market. Explain how
each policy addresses the problems using AD-AS analysis. (c) A critic argues "cutting corporate tax
is just a trickle-down policy that benefits the rich." Evaluate this argument economically.

**Solution:**

(a) Demand-side policies face a policy dilemma: expansionary policy would reduce unemployment but
worsen inflation; contractionary policy would reduce inflation but worsen unemployment. This is the
stagflation problem -- simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment that cannot be solved by
shifting AD alone. Supply-side policies that shift LRAS to the right can increase output and reduce
prices simultaneously, addressing both problems.

(b) (i) **Corporate tax cut**: Reduces costs of production, shifting SRAS and LRAS to the right.
Lower costs lead to lower prices (reducing inflation) and higher output (reducing unemployment).
Firms have more after-tax profit to reinvest, increasing capital stock and potential output.

(ii) **Vocational training**: Reduces structural unemployment by improving the match between
workers" skills and job requirements. This shifts LRAS right by increasing the productive capacity
of the labour force. Reduces the natural rate of unemployment.

(iii) **Labour market deregulation**: Reduces hiring and firing costs, increases labour market
flexibility. This reduces structural unemployment (easier for firms to hire during recovery, workers
more willing to accept jobs) and shifts LRAS right by making the labour market more efficient.

(c) The critic's argument has some merit but oversimplifies. Corporate tax cuts do primarily benefit
business owners and shareholders in the short run. However, the economic argument is that lower
corporate taxes: (1) increase investment (firms have more funds and higher after-tax returns), which
increases the capital stock and wages; (2) make the country more attractive for foreign direct
investment; (3) reduce the incentive for profit shifting and tax avoidance. The key question is
whether the supply-side response is large enough to offset the revenue loss. If the tax cut is
well-designed and the economy has room for investment, it can increase total tax revenue through a
larger tax base (Laffer curve effect). However, if corporate taxes are already low or if firms
pocket the savings without investing, the benefits may not trickle down.

## Additional DSE Exam-Style Questions

### EQ-1: Budget Deficit and National Debt Dynamics

**Question:** An economy has GDP $= HK\$3\,000$ billion, government revenue $= HK\$600$ billion,
government expenditure $= HK\$750$ billion, and outstanding national debt $= HK\$1\,800$ billion.
The average interest rate on government debt is $3\%$ and the GDP growth rate is $4\%$. (a)
Calculate the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP. (b) Calculate the debt-to-GDP ratio. (c) Using
the debt dynamics equation $\Delta d = (r - g) \cdot d_0 + p$Where $p$ is the primary deficit-to-GDP
ratio, determine whether the debt ratio is rising or falling. (d) If the government wants to
stabilise the debt ratio at its current level, what primary balance (as a percentage of GDP) must it
achieve?

**Solution:**

(a) Budget deficit $= 750 - 600 = HK\$150$ billion. As a percentage of GDP:
$\frac{150}{3000} \times 100\% = 5\%$.

(b) Debt-to-GDP ratio $= \frac{1800}{3000} = 60\%$.

(c) Primary deficit $= $ Budget deficit $-$ Interest payments
$= 150 - (0.03 \times 1800) = 150 - 54 = HK\$96$ billion. Primary deficit ratio
$P = \frac{96}{3000} = 3.2\%$.

$\Delta d = (r - g) \cdot d_0 + p = (0.03 - 0.04) \times 0.60 + 0.032 = -0.006 + 0.032 = 0.026$.

The debt ratio is **rising** by approximately 2.6 percentage points per year. Despite the favourable
interest-growth differential ($g \gt r$), the large primary deficit drives the debt ratio upward.

(d) For a stable debt ratio, $\Delta d = 0$: $(r - g) \cdot d_0 + p = 0$ So
$p = -(r - g) \cdot d_0 = -(0.03 - 0.04) \times 0.60 = 0.006 = 0.6\%$.

The government needs a **primary deficit** of at most $0.6\%$ of GDP, or equivalently a primary
surplus of $-0.6\%$. Current primary deficit is $3.2\%$ So it must reduce spending or increase
revenue by $(3.2\% - 0.6\%) \times 3000 = HK\$78$ billion.

### EQ-2: Discretionary Fiscal Policy with the AD-AS Model

**Question:** An economy is in long-run equilibrium at price level $P = 100$ and real output
$Y = HK\$2\,000$ billion. Potential output is $Y^* = HK\$2\,000$ billion. The government increases
spending by $HK\$80$ billion. The MPC $= 0.75$, the tax rate $T = 0.2$, and the MPM $= 0.15$. (a)
Calculate the full fiscal multiplier. (b) Calculate the change in equilibrium output. (c) If the
SRAS is upward-sloping with a price sensitivity such that the price level rises by 5% when output
rises by 10%, estimate the new equilibrium price level and output, accounting for the crowding out
effect through rising prices. (d) Evaluate the effectiveness of this fiscal expansion.

**Solution:**

(a) The multiplier with taxes and imports:
$k = \frac{1}{1 - MPC(1 - t) + MPM} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.75(1 - 0.2) + 0.15} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.60 + 0.15} = \frac{1}{0.55} = 1.818$.

(b) $\Delta Y = 1.818 \times 80 = HK\$145.5$ billion (theoretical maximum without crowding out).

(c) Output increase $= \frac{145.5}{2000} = 7.27\%$. Given the SRAS relationship (5% price rise for
10% output rise), the price rise $= 5\% \times \frac{7.27}{10} = 3.64\%$. New price level
$= 100 \times 1.0364 = 103.64$.

The rising price level reduces the real value of the money supply and raises interest rates,
crowding out some investment. If the crowding out effect reduces the multiplier by 20%, the
effective multiplier $= 1.818 \times 0.80 = 1.455$. Effective
$\Delta Y = 1.455 \times 80 = HK\$116.4$ billion. New output $= 2000 + 116.4 = HK\$2\,116.4$
billion.

(d) The fiscal expansion is moderately effective. It closes part of any output gap (if one existed),
but the crowding out effect and inflationary pressure reduce its impact. The multiplier of 1.455
(after crowding out) means the $HK\$80$B spending generates only $HK\$116.4$B of additional output.
The policy is most effective when: (1) the economy has significant spare capacity (flat SRAS), (2)
interest rates are not already near zero, and (3) the spending is on productive infrastructure
rather than recurrent expenditure.

### EQ-3: Quantitative Easing and Balance Sheet Effects

**Question:** The central bank undertakes quantitative easing (QE) by purchasing $HK\$200$ billion
of government bonds from commercial banks. (a) Explain how QE differs from conventional open market
operations. (b) If banks hold 5% of the new reserves as excess reserves and the required reserve
ratio is 8%, calculate the maximum expansion of broad money supply. (c) The central bank's balance
sheet before QE shows assets of $HK\$800$B (all government bonds) and liabilities of $HK\$800$B
(currency in circulation $HK\$300$B, bank reserves $HK\$500$B). Show the balance sheet after QE. (d)
Discuss two risks of large-scale QE.

**Solution:**

(a) Conventional OMOs involve small-scale purchases of short-term government bonds to target a
short-term interest rate. QE involves **large-scale** purchases of **longer-term** assets
(government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds) when short-term rates are already near zero. QE aims
to directly lower long-term interest rates, flatten the yield curve, and increase the money supply
when conventional policy is exhausted (liquidity trap).

(b) New reserves $= HK\$200$B. Excess reserves held $= 0.05 \times 200 = HK\$10$B. Reserves
available for lending $= 200 - 10 = HK\$190$B.

Maximum expansion $= \frac{190}{0.08} = HK\$2\,375$ billion of broad money.

(c) After QE:

- **Assets:** Government bonds $= 800 + 200 = HK\$1\,000$B.
- **Liabilities:** Currency $= HK\$300$B, Bank reserves $= 500 + 200 = HK\$700$B. Total liabilities
  $= HK\$1\,000$B.

(d) Two risks:

1. **Asset price inflation and financial instability:** QE pushes investors into riskier assets
   (search for yield), inflating stock, bond, and property prices beyond fundamentals. When QE
   unwinds, these asset bubbles may burst.
2. **Exit strategy difficulty:** Selling $HK\$200$B of bonds could depress bond prices and raise
   interest rates sharply, disrupting financial markets. The central bank may become trapped --
   unable to normalise its balance sheet without causing market turmoil.

### EQ-4: Hong Kong's Fiscal Policy Under the Linked Exchange Rate

**Question:** Hong Kong operates a Currency Board system with the HKD pegged at 7.8 to the USD. (a)
Explain why Hong Kong's monetary policy is essentially determined by the US Federal Reserve. (b)
Hong Kong's government records a budget deficit of HK\$100 billion during a recession. Since the
HKMA cannot independently set interest rates, what fiscal tools remain available? (c) Calculate the
impact on Hong Kong's fiscal reserves if the deficit persists for 3 years at HK\$100B per year,
starting from fiscal reserves of HK\$800B. (d) Evaluate the sustainability of Hong Kong's fiscal
position under prolonged economic downturn.

**Solution:**

(a) Under the Currency Board arrangement, the HKMA must maintain full backing of the monetary base
with US dollar reserves. When the Fed raises rates, capital flows from HK to the US, the HKMA must
sell USD and buy HKD to maintain the peg, reducing the HK money supply and pushing HK interest rates
up to match US rates. Hong Kong has **no independent monetary policy** -- this is the impossible
trinity in action (fixed exchange rate + free capital mobility = no independent monetary policy).

(b) Since monetary policy is unavailable, Hong Kong must rely on:

1. **Discretionary fiscal policy:** Increasing government spending on infrastructure, stimulus
   payments (e.g., consumption vouchers), tax rebates.
2. **Countercyclical fiscal buffers:** Drawing down fiscal reserves accumulated during boom years.
3. **Supply-side measures:** Reducing land premiums to lower housing costs, streamlining business
   registration, investing in innovation and technology.
4. **Exchange rate flexibility (limited):** While the peg is maintained, the HKD can trade within
   the Convertibility Zone (7.75--7.85), providing marginal adjustment.

(c) Year 1: Reserves $= 800 - 100 = 700$. Year 2: $700 - 100 = 600$. Year 3: $600 - 100 = 500$.

After 3 years, fiscal reserves $= HK\$500$ billion (a 37.5% decline).

(d) Sustainability assessment: Hong Kong's fiscal reserves are among the world's largest relative to
GDP (approximately 20--25% of GDP), providing a substantial buffer. A 3-year deficit of HK\$300B is
manageable. However, prolonged deficits combined with rising social welfare spending (ageing
population, healthcare) could erode reserves over a decade. Hong Kong has no central bank to
monetise debt, so deficits must be financed from reserves or bond issuance. The government's credit
rating and investor confidence depend on maintaining adequate reserves. A prudent approach is to
maintain fiscal reserves equivalent to at least 12 months of government expenditure.

### EQ-5: Taxation and Labour Supply -- Income and Substitution Effects

**Question:** A worker earns HK\$30,000 per month and works 160 hours. The government introduces a
flat tax of 10% on income above HK\$15,000 (the personal allowance). The worker's after-tax hourly
wage falls from HK\$187.5 to HK\$175. (a) Calculate the worker's monthly tax payment and after-tax
income. (b) Using the income and substitution effects framework, explain how the tax might affect
the worker's labour supply. (c) If the worker's elasticity of labour supply is $-0.2$Calculate the
percentage change in hours worked. (d) Explain the Laffer curve concept and identify the tax rate at
which revenue is maximised, assuming a revenue-maximising tax rate of 40%.

**Solution:**

(a) Taxable income $= 30\,000 - 15\,000 = HK\$15\,000$. Tax $= 0.10 \times 15\,000 = HK\$1\,500$.
After-tax income $= 30\,000 - 1\,500 = HK\$28\,500$.

(b) The tax creates two opposing effects on labour supply:

1. **Substitution effect:** The after-tax wage falls (from HK\$187.5 to HK\$175), making leisure
   cheaper relative to work. The worker substitutes towards leisure and **reduces** labour supply.
2. **Income effect:** The lower after-tax income makes the worker feel poorer. To maintain their
   standard of living, the worker may **increase** labour supply (work more hours to compensate).

The net effect depends on which effect dominates. For low-income workers, the income effect tends to
dominate (work more). For high-income workers with high target incomes, the substitution effect
often dominates (work less).

(c) Elasticity of labour supply $= \frac{\%\Delta H}{\%\Delta W}$. Percentage change in after-tax
wage $= \frac{175 - 187.5}{187.5} = -6.67\%$.

$\%\Delta H = -0.2 \times (-6.67\%) = 1.33\%$. Hours increase by $1.33\%$ to
$160 \times 1.0133 = 162.1$ hours. The negative elasticity means the income effect dominates
(backward-bending supply curve).

(d) The Laffer curve shows the relationship between the tax rate and tax revenue. At a tax rate of
0%, revenue is zero. As the tax rate rises, revenue initially increases, but beyond a certain point,
higher rates discourage economic activity so much that revenue **falls**. At a 100% tax rate, nobody
works and revenue is zero. The revenue-maximising rate is where the Laffer curve peaks. If this peak
is at 40%, then raising the tax rate above 40% would actually **reduce** total tax revenue by
shrinking the tax base more than the higher rate compensates.

### EQ-6: Monetary Policy in a Small Open Economy

**Question:** Country S is a small open economy with a floating exchange rate. The central bank
raises the policy interest rate by 1 percentage point. (a) Explain the effect on the exchange rate,
using the interest rate parity condition. (b) If exports are HK\$400 billion and imports are HK\$500
billion, and the Marshall-Lerner condition holds with PED of exports $= 0.8$ and PED of imports
$= 1.2$Calculate the effect of a 5% currency appreciation on the trade balance. (c) Explain why the
impact on GDP differs between a small open economy and a large closed economy. (d) The central bank
simultaneously sells domestic bonds worth HK\$50 billion. Calculate the combined effect on the money
supply given a money multiplier of 5.

**Solution:**

(a) Higher domestic interest rates attract foreign capital inflows, as investors seek higher
returns. The increased demand for the domestic currency causes it to **appreciate**. By uncovered
interest rate parity: $i_d = i_f + \frac{E^e - E}{E}$. If $i_d$ rises and $i_f$ and $E^e$ are
unchanged, $E$ (the spot exchange rate, domestic currency per foreign currency) must fall -- meaning
the domestic currency appreciates.

(b) Current trade balance $= X - M = 400 - 500 = -HK\$100$ billion (deficit).

A 5% appreciation makes exports 5% more expensive for foreigners and imports 5% cheaper
domestically.

$\%\Delta X = -PED_X \times \%\Delta P_X = -0.8 \times 5 = -4\%$. New exports
$= 400 \times 0.96 = HK\$384$ billion.

$\%\Delta M = -PED_M \times \%\Delta P_M = -1.2 \times (-5) = +6\%$. New imports
$= 500 \times 1.06 = HK\$530$ billion.

New trade balance $= 384 - 530 = -HK\$146$ billion. The deficit **widens** by HK\$46 billion because
the Marshall-Lerner condition is just satisfied ($PED_X + PED_M = 2.0 \gt 1$), but the appreciation
initially worsens the trade balance in the short run (J-curve effect).

(c) In a **small open economy**, higher interest rates cause currency appreciation, which
significantly reduces net exports. The negative export effect partially or fully offsets the
contractionary domestic effect of higher rates on investment and consumption. In a **large closed
economy**, the exchange rate channel is absent, so higher rates reduce GDP primarily through lower
investment and consumption. The net effect of monetary tightening is therefore **smaller** in a
small open economy with a floating exchange rate than in a closed economy -- this is the
Mundell-Fleming result.

(d) Selling HK\$50 billion in bonds removes HK\$50 billion from bank reserves. With a money
multiplier of 5: $\Delta M = 5 \times (-50) = -HK\$250$ billion. The money supply contracts by
HK\$250 billion, reinforcing the contractionary effect of the interest rate increase.

## Intuition

**A steering wheel for the economy:** Fiscal policy is the government's tax-and-spend lever; monetary policy is the central bank's interest rate lever. Both aim to steer the economy between overheating and recession.

**Why it matters:** These tools determine inflation rates, unemployment levels, and economic growth. Understanding them helps predict how governments respond to crises.

**The key insight:** The multiplier effect means a small government spending increase can ripple through the economy — but leakages (savings, imports) reduce the impact.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing the spending multiplier with the tax multiplier:** The spending multiplier is
   $\frac{1}{1-MPC}$ while the tax multiplier is $\frac{-MPC}{1-MPC}$. The tax multiplier is always
   smaller in absolute value because households save a portion of any tax cut (the MPS leaks out of
   the circular flow immediately).

2. **Ignoring leakages in the multiplier:** The simple multiplier $\frac{1}{1-MPC}$ overestimates
   the real-world impact. Students must account for taxation (reducing disposable income), imports
   (leakage to foreign economies), and savings. The full multiplier is
   $\frac{1}{1 - MPC(1-t) + MPM}$.

3. **Applying demand-side policy to supply-side problems:** Stagflation (simultaneous high inflation
   and high unemployment) cannot be solved by shifting AD alone. Demand expansion worsens inflation;
   demand contraction worsens unemployment. Supply-side policies are needed.

4. **Forgetting the impossible trinity:** Under a fixed exchange rate with free capital mobility,
   monetary policy is not independent. Students often prescribe interest rate changes for Hong Kong
   without recognising the Currency Board constraint.

5. **Assuming the full multiplier materialises:** Time lags (recognition lag, decision lag,
   implementation lag, impact lag), crowding out, and behavioural responses mean the actual
   multiplier is 30--50% of the theoretical maximum in empirical studies.

## Additional DSE Exam-Style Questions

### EQ-7: Laffer Curve and Optimal Taxation

**Question:** The government of Country A currently levies a flat income tax rate of 30%. Taxable
income before tax is $\$500$ billion. Empirical research suggests that the taxable income elasticity
(the percentage change in taxable income in response to a 1% change in the net-of-tax rate) is 0.4.
(a) Calculate current tax revenue. (b) If the government increases the tax rate to 35%, calculate
the new tax revenue. Does the Laffer curve predict that this will increase or decrease revenue? (c)
Calculate the revenue-maximising tax rate. (d) Explain why the revenue-maximising tax rate is not
the optimal tax rate from a welfare perspective.

**Solution:**

(a) Current tax revenue $= 0.30 \times 500 = \$150$ billion.

(b) The net-of-tax rate falls from $1 - 0.30 = 0.70$ to $1 - 0.35 = 0.65$. This is a change of
$\frac{0.65 - 0.70}{0.70} = -7.14\%$.

Taxable income changes by: $0.4 \times (-7.14\%) = -2.86\%$.

New taxable income $= 500 \times (1 - 0.0286) = \$485.7$ billion.

New tax revenue $= 0.35 \times 485.7 = \$170.0$ billion.

Tax revenue increases from $\$150$B to $\$170$B. The Laffer curve predicts that at a 30% tax rate,
we are on the upward-sloping portion of the curve (below the revenue-maximising rate), so a tax rate
increase still raises revenue.

(c) The revenue-maximising tax rate is where $\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$. With a taxable income elasticity
of $e = 0.4$:

Revenue $R = t \times B(t)$Where $B(t)$ is the tax base.

$\frac{dR}{dt} = B + t \times \frac{dB}{dt} = 0$.

Using the elasticity formulation: $\frac{dB}{dt} = -\frac{{}e \times B{}}{1 - t}$.

$B + t \times \frac{-eB}{1-t} = 0$. $1 - \frac{et}{1-t} = 0$. $1 - t = et$. $1 = t(e + 1)$.
$t^* = \frac{1}{e + 1} = \frac{1}{1.4} = 71.4\%$.

The revenue-maximising tax rate is approximately 71.4%.

(d) The revenue-maximising tax rate is not optimal from a welfare perspective because: (i) at a
71.4% tax rate, the deadweight loss is enormous -- a large amount of economic activity is
discouraged purely to raise revenue; (ii) the marginal cost of public funds (the welfare cost of
raising an additional dollar of revenue) exceeds 1 at high tax rates, meaning each dollar of revenue
costs society more than a dollar in welfare; (iii) high tax rates create incentives for tax
avoidance and evasion, distorting economic decisions. The optimal tax rate balances the marginal
benefit of government spending against the marginal deadweight loss of taxation. For most economies,
this optimal rate is well below the revenue-maximising rate -- in the range of 30--50% for income
taxes.

### EQ-8: Phillips Curve and the Trade-off Between Inflation and Unemployment

**Question:** An economy has the following Phillips curve: $\pi = \pi^e - 0.5(u - 5) + 0.1x$Where
$\pi$ is inflation, $\pi^e$ is expected inflation, $u$ is the unemployment rate, and $x$ is a supply
shock (0 in normal times). The natural rate of unemployment is 5%. (a) If expected inflation is 3%
and actual unemployment is 5%, calculate the inflation rate. (b) If the government uses expansionary
policy to reduce unemployment to 3%, calculate the inflation rate in the short run (assuming
expectations are unchanged). (c) In the long run, expectations adjust. Calculate the long-run
inflation rate if the government permanently maintains unemployment at 3%. (d) Explain why there is
no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

**Solution:**

(a) $\pi = 3 - 0.5(5 - 5) + 0 = 3\%$. When unemployment equals the natural rate and there is no
supply shock, inflation equals expected inflation (3%).

(b) With $u = 3$: $\pi = 3 - 0.5(3 - 5) + 0 = 3 - 0.5(-2) = 3 + 1 = 4\%$.

Inflation rises to 4%. The government achieves lower unemployment (3% vs 5%) at the cost of higher
inflation (4% vs 3%). This is the short-run Phillips curve trade-off.

(c) In the long run, expected inflation adjusts to actual inflation: $\pi^e = \pi$. Substituting
$\pi^e = \pi$:

$\pi = \pi - 0.5(3 - 5)$. $0 = -0.5(-2) = 1$. This is a contradiction.

The correct long-run analysis: when expectations catch up, the short-run Phillips curve shifts up.
In the long run, unemployment returns to the natural rate regardless of inflation. If the government
tries to keep unemployment at 3%, it must continually generate accelerating inflation (the
accelerationist hypothesis). The long-run Phillips curve is vertical at $u = 5\%$.

The long-run inflation rate depends on the monetary policy stance (money supply growth). If the
central bank accommodates the fiscal expansion by increasing the money supply, inflation will rise
to whatever level is consistent with $u = 5\%$ on the long-run Phillips curve.

(d) The long-run Phillips curve is vertical because in the long run, all prices and wages are
flexible. Workers and firms adjust their expectations to the actual inflation rate. Nominal wages
rise to match inflation, eliminating any real wage effect. The real wage returns to its equilibrium
level, and unemployment returns to the natural rate. Any attempt to keep unemployment below the
natural rate requires ever-increasing inflation (as expectations continuously catch up), which is
unsustainable. This is the **natural rate hypothesis** (Friedman, 1968; Phelps, 1967).

### EQ-9: Fiscal Policy and Automatic Stabilisers

**Question:** An economy's tax system has a marginal tax rate of 25% and unemployment benefits that
replace 40% of previous wages. The economy enters a recession: GDP falls from $\$1000$ billion to
$\$900$ billion, and unemployment rises from 5% to 8%. There are 50 million workers, and the average
wage is $\$50\,000$. (a) Calculate the automatic change in tax revenue. (b) Calculate the automatic
increase in unemployment benefit spending. (c) Calculate the automatic change in the budget balance.
(d) Explain how automatic stabilisers work and why they are superior to discretionary fiscal policy.

**Solution:**

(a) GDP falls by $\$100$ billion. With a marginal tax rate of 25%, tax revenue falls by
approximately $0.25 \times 100 = \$25$ billion. (This is approximate because it assumes the entire
GDP decline is taxable income; in practice, some of the GDP decline is corporate profit and some is
labour income with different tax treatments.)

(b) Unemployment rises from 5% to 8%, an increase of 3 percentage points. New unemployed workers
$= 0.03 \times 50\,000\,000 = 1\,500\,000$.

Annual unemployment benefit per worker $= 0.40 \times 50\,000 = \$20\,000$.

Increase in unemployment benefit spending $= 1\,500\,000 \times 20\,000 = \$30$ billion.

(c) Automatic change in budget balance
$= -25 \text{ (revenue loss)} - 30 \text{ (spending increase)} = -\$55$ billion.

The budget deficit automatically widens by $\$55$ billion. This is an automatic stabiliser: the
deficit provides stimulus without any deliberate government action.

(d) **How automatic stabilisers work:** During a recession, falling incomes reduce tax revenue
(progressive tax system means tax revenue falls faster than income) and rising unemployment
increases transfer payments (unemployment benefits, welfare). These automatic changes in the budget
balance partially offset the decline in aggregate demand, cushioning the recession. During a boom,
the reverse happens: rising incomes increase tax revenue and falling unemployment reduces transfers,
cooling the economy.

**Why they are superior to discretionary policy:**

1. **No time lag:** Automatic stabilisers respond immediately to economic conditions, whereas
   discretionary policy involves recognition lags, decision lags, and implementation lags
   (potentially 12--18 months).
2. **No political bias:** Automatic stabilisers are built into the tax and transfer system and
   operate without political negotiation. Discretionary policy is subject to political
   considerations (elections, lobbying) that may delay or distort the response.
3. **Counter-cyclical by design:** They automatically provide stimulus during recessions and
   restraint during booms, without requiring policymakers to correctly identify the phase of the
   business cycle.
4. **Predictable:** Firms and households can anticipate the automatic stabiliser effects, reducing
   uncertainty.

**Limitation:** The magnitude of automatic stabilisers is limited by the tax rate and benefit
structure. A country with low tax rates and limited social benefits (like Hong Kong) has weaker
automatic stabilisers than a European welfare state.

## Additional Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing the budget deficit with the national debt:** The budget deficit is a _flow_ (the
   annual shortfall of revenue over spending). The national debt is a _stock_ (the accumulated total
   of all past deficits minus surpluses). A country can have a large debt but a small deficit (or
   even a surplus), and vice versa. In DSE questions, read carefully whether the question asks about
   the deficit or the debt.

2. **Applying the multiplier formula without checking the conditions:** The simple multiplier
   $\frac{1}{1-MPC}$ assumes: (i) no taxation, (ii) no imports, (iii) no capacity constraints (the
   economy has spare resources), (iv) constant prices. If any of these conditions fail, the actual
   multiplier is smaller. In an economy at full employment, the multiplier is approximately zero
   because output cannot increase; the only effect is higher prices.

3. **Assuming monetary policy is equally effective across exchange rate regimes:** Under a fixed
   exchange rate (like Hong Kong's Currency Board), monetary policy is not independent. Under a
   floating exchange rate, monetary policy affects the economy through the interest rate channel,
   the exchange rate channel, and the asset price channel. The relative importance of these channels
   depends on the economy's openness (the Mundell-Fleming model). For a small open economy with a
   floating exchange rate, the exchange rate channel may dominate, potentially weakening the
   domestic effect of monetary policy.
