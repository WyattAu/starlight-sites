This document covers the system development lifecycle (SDLC) for the DSE ICT examination.
Understanding The SDLC is essential for analysing how information systems are developed, from
initial problem Identification through to ongoing maintenance.

## Overview of the System Development Lifecycle

The system development lifecycle (SDLC) is a structured methodology for developing information
systems. It consists of distinct phases, each with specific activities and deliverables.

### Phases of the SDLC

| Phase              | Purpose                                                  | Key Deliverables                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Analysis**       | Understand the problem and identify requirements         | Requirements specification, feasibility study |
| **Design**         | Plan the solution (hardware, software, data, UI)         | System specifications, designs, diagrams      |
| **Implementation** | Build the system according to the design                 | Working system, programs, database            |
| **Testing**        | Verify the system works correctly and meets requirements | Test reports, bug fixes                       |

## Phase 2: Design

### Phase 2: Design Purpose

The design phase plans how the system will be built. It translates the requirements into detailed
Specifications for hardware, software, data, and user interface.

### Design Activities

| Activity                  | Description                                                        |

## Phase 3: Implementation

### Phase 3: Implementation Purpose

The implementation phase builds the system according to the design specifications. This includes
Writing software, installing hardware, configuring the system, and migrating data.

### Implementation Methods

| Method                    | Description                                                  | Advantage                        | Disadvantage                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Direct changeover**     | Old system is replaced by the new system on a single date    | Quick, low parallel running cost | High risk; no fallback                     |
| **Parallel running**      | Both old and new systems run simultaneously for a period     | Safe; can compare results        | Expensive; double workload                 |
| **Phased implementation** | System is introduced in stages, one module at a time         | Lower risk per phase             | Takes longer; temporary hybrid             |
| **Pilot running**         | New system is trialled with one department or location first | Risk limited to pilot group      | Pilot may not represent whole organisation |

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Choosing an Implementation Method</summary>

**Scenario:** A hospital is replacing its patient record system with a new electronic health record
(EHR) system.

**Recommendation: Phased implementation, starting with a pilot.**

Reasoning:

1. **Direct changeover is too risky:** Patient safety is critical. If the new system fails, doctors
   would have no access to patient records, which could endanger lives.
2. **Parallel running is impractical:** Doctors and nurses already have heavy workloads. Maintaining
   two systems simultaneously would be burdensome and error-prone.
3. **Phased implementation with pilot:** Start with one department (e.g., outpatients) as a pilot.
   Identify and fix issues before rolling out to other departments (inpatients, surgery, pharmacy).
   This limits risk while allowing iterative improvement.

**Rollout plan:**

| Phase | Department  | Duration | Notes                                |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Outpatients | 2 months | Pilot; intensive monitoring          |
| 2     | Inpatients  | 2 months | Apply lessons from Phase 1           |
| 3     | Pharmacy    | 1 month  | Integration with prescription system |
| 4     | Surgery     | 1 month  | Final department                     |

</details>

### Data Migration

Moving data from the old system to the new system requires careful planning.

| Step | Activity            | Purpose                                    |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Data extraction     | Extract data from the old system           |
| 2    | Data cleaning       | Remove duplicates, fix errors, standardise |
| 3    | Data transformation | Convert to the new system"s format         |
| 4    | Data loading        | Import into the new system                 |
| 5    | Data verification   | Compare old and new data for consistency   |

### Post-Implementation Review

A formal review conducted after the system has been in use for a defined period ( 3--6 months).

**Questions to address:**

1. Does the system meet all functional requirements?
2. Are there any performance issues?
3. What problems have users encountered?
4. Are there any features that users want but were not included?
5. Is the documentation adequate?
6. What training gaps exist?
7. What maintenance has been required?
8. Was the project completed within budget and schedule?

## Phase 7: Maintenance

### Types of Maintenance

| Type           | Description                                               | Example                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Corrective** | Fixing bugs and errors discovered after deployment        | Fix a calculation error in payroll system |
| **Adaptive**   | Modifying the system to work in a changed environment     | Update software for new operating system  |
| **Perfective** | Improving the system's performance or adding new features | Add a reporting module requested by users |
| **Preventive** | Performing maintenance to prevent future problems         | Update database indexes to maintain speed |

### Maintenance Costs

Maintenance accounts for 60--80% of the total cost of a system over its lifetime. This is Often
underestimated during the initial project planning.

---

## Project Management

### Gantt Charts

A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart that shows the project schedule. Each task is represented as
a Bar, with the bar's length proportional to the task's duration.

```
Task                | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 |
--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

### Critical Path Analysis

The critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum project duration. Any delay
on The critical path delays the entire project.

**Float (slack):** The amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the project deadline.

- Tasks on the critical path have zero float.
- Tasks not on the critical path have positive float (can be delayed without affecting the
  deadline).

## Change Management

### Why Change Management Matters

Introducing a new system changes how people work. Resistance to change is natural and must be
managed To ensure successful adoption.

### Strategies for Managing Change

| Strategy                    | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Communication**           | Keep all stakeholders informed about the change and its benefits     |
| **Training**                | Provide comprehensive training before and after the change           |
| **Involvement**             | Involve users in the design and testing phases                       |
| **Champion identification** | Identify enthusiastic users who can advocate for the system          |
| **Phased introduction**     | Introduce changes gradually to reduce disruption                     |
| **Feedback mechanism**      | Provide channels for users to report issues and suggest improvements |
| **Management support**      | Visible support from senior management                               |

### Reasons for Resistance to Change

| Reason                    | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fear of redundancy**    | Concern that the new system will eliminate jobs                     |
| **Comfort with current**  | Users are familiar with the existing system and reluctant to change |
| **Lack of understanding** | Users do not understand the benefits of the new system              |
| **Inadequate training**   | Users feel unprepared to use the new system                         |
| **Poor past experiences** | Previous system changes were handled badly                          |
| **Increased workload**    | The transition period requires extra effort from users              |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping the analysis phase:** Jumping straight to implementation without proper requirements
   analysis leads to a system that does not meet users' needs. The analysis phase is critical for
   understanding the problem.

2. **Insufficient testing:** Testing only with normal data misses edge cases and error conditions. A
   comprehensive test plan must include boundary, erroneous, extreme, and absent data.

3. **Poor documentation:** Documentation is often treated as an afterthought. Inadequate
   documentation makes the system difficult to use, maintain, and support.

4. **Ignoring user feedback:** Users who will operate the system daily often have practical insights
   that analysts miss. Ignoring their feedback leads to poor user acceptance.

5. **Underestimating maintenance:** Many projects fail to budget for ongoing maintenance, which can
   account for 60--80% of total system costs over its lifetime.

6. **No feasibility study:** Starting a project without assessing feasibility wastes resources on
   projects that may not be technically, economically, or operationally viable.

7. **Direct changeover without backup:** Switching to a new system without a fallback plan is
   extremely risky. If the new system fails, there is no way to continue operations.

8. **Critical path not identified:** Failing to identify the critical path means resources may not
   be allocated to the most time-sensitive tasks, causing project delays.

9. **Inadequate training:** Users who are not properly trained will resist the new system, make more
   errors, and reduce the system's effectiveness.

10. **Scope creep:** Adding new requirements during the project without adjusting the budget and
    schedule leads to delays, cost overruns, and incomplete systems.

## Practice Problems

<details>
<summary>Question 1: SDLC Phases</summary>

A school is developing a new student attendance tracking system that uses RFID cards to record
Attendance automatically.

(a) For the analysis phase, describe two fact-finding methods that would be appropriate and explain
what information each would gather.

(b) For the design phase, state two types of documentation that should be produced and describe
their contents.

(c) Recommend an implementation method and justify your choice.

(d) Describe two types of testing that should be performed before the system goes live.

Answer:

(a) **Interviews with teachers:** Teachers currently take manual attendance. Interviews would reveal
Their current workflow, pain points (e.g., time wasted, inaccurate records), and what features they
Need in the new system.

**Observation:** Observe the morning registration process to understand exactly how attendance is
Currently recorded, how long it takes, and what problems arise (e.g., students forgetting to report,
Proxy attendance).

(b) **Data flow diagram:** Shows how attendance data flows from the RFID scanner through the system
to The attendance database and then to reports viewed by teachers and parents.

**User interface design:** Mockups of the teacher's dashboard showing real-time attendance status,
Absence alerts, and report generation features.

(c) **Pilot running.** Start with one class or one form level as a pilot. This limits risk -- if the
RFID system has issues (e.g., readers not scanning cards reliably), only the pilot group is
affected. Problems can be identified and fixed before rolling out to the entire school.

(d) **Integration testing:** Test that the RFID readers communicate correctly with the central
system, that attendance data is stored accurately in the database, and that the teacher dashboard
displays correct information.

**Acceptance testing:** Teachers and administrators use the system in their normal environment and
verify that it meets their requirements (accurate attendance recording, timely reporting, easy to
use).

<summary>Question 2: Feasibility Study</summary>

A small retail shop with 3 employees is considering installing a barcode-based point-of-sale (POS)
System to replace their current manual cash register.

(a) Assess the technical, economic, and operational feasibility of this project.

(b) Identify three stakeholders and explain their interest in the project.

Answer:

(a) **Technical feasibility:** Barcode scanners and POS software are mature, widely available
Technologies. The shop has a computer that can run POS software. A barcode scanner costs
approximately HKD 500--2,000. Basic POS software is available from HKD 2,000--10,000. No specialised
technical Expertise is needed for installation. **Assessment: Feasible.**

**Economic feasibility:** One-time costs: POS software (HKD 5,000), barcode scanner (HKD 1,000),
Barcode printer for labels (HKD 1,500), training (HKD 1,000) = total HKD 8,500. Ongoing costs:
Software maintenance (HKD 1,000/year). Benefits: faster checkout (save ~5 min per transaction),
Reduced errors in pricing and change-giving, automatic inventory tracking, better sales reporting.
Estimated savings: HKD 3,000--5,000/year. **Assessment: Feasible. Payback period ~2 years.**

**Operational feasibility:** With only 3 employees, training is minimal (1--2 days). The POS system
Simplifies their work (no manual price lookup, automatic inventory updates). Risk of resistance is
Low if employees see the time savings. **Assessment: Feasible.**

(b) Three stakeholders:

1. **Shop owner:** Wants accurate financial reporting, inventory tracking, reduced errors, and
   increased profitability. Has the decision-making power.
2. **Shop assistants:** Want a system that is easy to use, speeds up checkout, and does not create
   extra work. Concerned about learning a new system.
3. **Customers:** Benefit from faster checkout, accurate pricing, and itemised receipts. Indirect
   stakeholders who do not use the system directly.

<summary>Question 3: Gantt Chart and Critical Path</summary>

A project has the following tasks and dependencies:

| Task             | Duration (weeks) | Dependencies |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| A: Analysis      | 3                | None         |
| B: Design        | 4                | A            |
| C: Programming   | 6                | B            |
| D: Testing       | 2                | C            |
| E: Documentation | 3                | C            |
| F: Training      | 1                | D, E         |
| G: Evaluation    | 2                | F            |

(a) Draw the Gantt chart (describe the schedule in text).

(b) Identify the critical path.

(c) Calculate the minimum project duration.

(d) Task E is delayed by 1 week. Does this affect the project completion date? Explain.

Answer:

(a) Schedule (week numbers when tasks start):

| Task             | Start | End | Weeks Active |
| ---------------- | ----- | --- | ------------ |
| A: Analysis      | 1     | 3   | 1, 2, 3      |
| B: Design        | 4     | 7   | 4, 5, 6, 7   |
| C: Programming   | 8     | 13  | 8--13        |
| D: Testing       | 14    | 15  | 14, 15       |
| E: Documentation | 14    | 16  | 14, 15, 16   |
| F: Training      | 17    | 17  | 17           |
| G: Evaluation    | 18    | 19  | 18, 19       |

(b) **Critical path: A --> B --> C --> D --> F --> G**

(c) Critical path length: 3 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 18 weeks. Minimum project duration: 18 weeks.

(d) Task E (Documentation) has a duration of 3 weeks and is followed by Task F (Training). Task F
Depends on both D and E. Task D ends at week 15. If E is delayed by 1 week (now ends at week 17
Instead of 16), F starts at week 17 (when both D and E are complete). Since F only takes 1 week And
starts at week 17, and G follows at week 18, the overall project is NOT delayed. Task E had 1 Week
of float (E could finish as late as week 16 without affecting F's start at week 17). A 1-week Delay
uses up this float but does not extend the project.

<summary>Question 4: Testing and Evaluation</summary>

A hospital's new patient booking system has just been developed. The system allows patients to book
Appointments online, receive confirmation emails, and allows staff to manage the appointment
calendar.

(a) Describe three types of testing that should be performed, with specific examples for this
system.

(b) After 3 months of operation, describe how the hospital should evaluate the system.

(c) A user reports that when they try to book an appointment on 29 February (a non-leap year), the
system accepts the booking. What type of test would have caught this error?

Answer:

(a) **Unit testing:** Test individual functions in isolation. For example, test the date validation
Function with various dates to ensure it correctly identifies valid and invalid dates.

**Integration testing:** Test that the booking module correctly interacts with the email module
(confirmation emails are sent), the database (appointments are stored correctly), and the calendar
Display (booked slots are marked as unavailable).

**Acceptance testing:** Hospital staff and a sample of patients use the system to perform real tasks
(booking an appointment, cancelling, rescheduling) and verify that the system meets their
requirements.

**Security testing:** Test that unauthorised users cannot access patient records, that SQL injection
Attacks are prevented, and that patient data is encrypted in transit.

(b) **Evaluation methods:**

1. **User satisfaction survey:** Ask patients and staff to rate the system on ease of use,
   reliability, and features.
2. **Quantitative metrics:** Measure the reduction in phone calls for appointments, the percentage
   of appointments booked online vs phone, and the average time to book an appointment.
3. **Error log analysis:** Review system logs for bugs, crashes, or failed transactions.
4. **Comparison with objectives:** Compare actual performance against the original requirements
   specification (e.g., "reduce phone booking calls by 50%").

(c) This is a **boundary test** error. The date 29 February 2025 is invalid (2025 is not a leap
year). Boundary testing should test dates at the edges of valid ranges, including the last day of
February For both leap years and non-leap years. The test should verify that the system correctly
rejects 29 February for non-leap years and accepts it for leap years.

<summary>Question 5: Change Management Scenario</summary>

A large company is replacing its legacy payroll system with a modern cloud-based system. Many
employees Have used the old system for 15+ years and are resistant to the change.

(a) Identify three reasons why employees might resist this change.

(b) Describe three change management strategies the company should use to overcome resistance.

(c) Explain why parallel running would be inappropriate for this project and recommend an
alternative.

Answer:

(a) **Three reasons for resistance:**

1. **Comfort with the current system:** Employees have used the old system for 15+ years and are
   highly proficient. They fear the learning curve of the new system.
2. **Fear of job loss:** Employees may worry that automation in the new system will make their roles
   redundant.
3. **Disruption during transition:** Learning the new system while performing their normal duties
   increases workload and stress. Mistakes during the learning period could affect payroll accuracy.

(b) **Three change management strategies:**

1. **Involvement:** Include payroll staff representatives in the design and testing phases. When
   users help shape the system, they feel ownership and are more likely to accept it.
2. **Comprehensive training:** Provide hands-on training sessions well before the go-live date.
   Offer refresher sessions and a help desk for the first few months. Training reduces anxiety and
   builds competence.
3. **Identify champions:** Find enthusiastic, influential employees who can advocate for the new
   system among their peers. Positive word-of-mouth from trusted colleagues is more effective than
   top-down mandates.

(c) **Parallel running is inappropriate** because payroll involves sensitive financial data. Running
two payroll systems simultaneously means processing payroll twice per month, which doubles the
workload for payroll staff. Any discrepancy between the two systems creates confusion and requires
manual reconciliation.

**Alternative: Phased implementation.** Start with one department or one payroll cycle (e.g., run
the June payroll on the new system while running May on the old system). Verify results, fix issues,
and then switch completely. This limits risk without the burden of full parallel running.
