Statistics is the branch of mathematics concerned with the collection, organisation, analysis, and
Interpretation of data. In the DSE compulsory syllabus, we focus on **descriptive
./4-statistics-and-probability/2_statistics** -- Summarising a dataset through measures of central
tendency and measures of dispersion. This page Also covers grouped data techniques and graphical
representations such as box-and-whisker plots. These tools are frequently combined with
[probability](11_probability.md) concepts in exam questions.

## Measures of Central Tendency

A measure of central tendency identifies a single value that is representative of an entire dataset.

### Mean

The **mean** (arithmetic average) of a dataset $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ is defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
\end{aligned}
$$

The mean uses every data value, making it sensitive to outliers. It is the only measure of central
Tendency that lends itself to algebraic manipulation (e.g., combining datasets).

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- The scores of $5$ students are $72, 85, 90, 68, 80$. The mean is $\bar{x} = \frac{72+85+90+68+80}{5} = \frac{395}{5} = 79$.
- If every score is increased by $5$ bonus marks, the new mean is $79 + 5 = 84$.

### Median

The **median** is the middle value of an ordered dataset. For $n$ data values sorted in ascending
Order:

- If $n$ is odd, the median is the value at position $\dfrac{n+1}{2}$.
- If $n$ is even, the median is the average of the values at positions $\dfrac{n}{2}$ and
  $\dfrac{n}{2}+1$.

The median is robust to outliers since only on the position of data points, not their Magnitude.

</details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- Dataset: $\{3, 7, 1, 9, 5\}$. Sorted: $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$. Median = $5$ (position $3$ of $5$).
- Dataset: $\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\}$. Median = $\frac{6+8}{2} = 7$ (average of positions $3$ and $4$).
- Salaries: $\{18000, 20000, 22000, 25000, 150000\}$. Median = $22000$Which is far more representative than the mean of $47000$.

### Mode

The **mode** is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may be unimodal (one
Mode), bimodal (two modes), multimodal, or have no mode at all.

The mode is the only measure of central tendency applicable to nominal (categorical) data.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- $\{4, 2, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8\}$: mode = $4$ (appears $3$ times).
- $\{5, 5, 8, 8, 10\}$: bimodal, modes are $5$ and $8$.
- $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$: no mode.

### Comparison of the Three Measures

| Measure | Uses all values | Affected by outliers | Applicable to categorical data | Unique value |
| ------- | :-------------: | :------------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------: |
| Mean    |       Yes       |         Yes          |               No               |     Yes      |
| Median  |       No        |          No          |               No               |     Yes      |
| Mode    |       No        |          No          |              Yes               |      No      |

## Measures of Dispersion

Measures of dispersion (spread) quantify how far individual data values deviate from the centre. Two
Datasets can share the same mean yet have very different spreads.

### Range

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \mathrm{Range} = \mathrm{Maximum value} - \mathrm{Minimum value}
\end{aligned}
$$

The range is simple to compute but uses only two data points, making it highly sensitive to
Outliers.

</details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- $\{12, 15, 18, 22, 25\}$: range $= 25 - 12 = 13$.
- $\{5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 100\}$: range $= 95$Heavily distorted by the single outlier.

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

The **quartiles** divide an ordered dataset into four equal parts:

- $Q_1$ (lower quartile): the median of the lower half.
- $Q_2$ (median): the middle value.
- $Q_3$ (upper quartile): the median of the upper half.

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \mathrm{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
\end{aligned}
$$

The IQR is resistant to outliers since it ignores the most extreme $50\%$ of data.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- Dataset: $\{3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 25\}$ ($n=9$Odd).
 - Lower half: $\{3, 5, 7, 8\}$, $Q_1 = \frac{5+7}{2} = 6$.
 - $Q_2 = 12$.
 - Upper half: $\{14, 18, 20, 25\}$, $Q_3 = \frac{18+20}{2} = 19$.
 - IQR $= 19 - 6 = 13$.

### Variance

Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. There are two versions depending on
Whether the data represents the **entire population** or a **sample** drawn from a larger
Population.

**Population variance** (divides by $n$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

**Sample variance** (divides by $n-1$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
 s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

An equivalent computational formula is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 - \frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\right)^2\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

**Why $n$ vs $n-1$?** Dividing by $n-1$ (Bessel"s correction) provides an _unbiased_ estimator of
The population variance when working with a sample. Using only $n$ data points, the sample mean
$\bar{x}$ is closer to the data points than the true population mean $\mu$So the squared Deviations
tend to underestimate the true spread. Dividing by $n-1$ compensates for this. In the DSE Syllabus,
unless the problem explicitly identifies the data as a sample, the population formula (dividing by
$n$) is expected.

</details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- Dataset: $\{2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\}$ ($n=8$).
 - $\bar{x} = \frac{40}{8} = 5$.
 - $\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 32$.
 - Population variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{32}{8} = 4$.
 - Sample variance: $s^2 = \frac{32}{7} \approx 4.57$.

### Standard Deviation

The **standard deviation** is the positive square root of the variance, restoring the units to match
The original data:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}, \qquad s = \sqrt{s^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the standard deviation is in the same units as the data, it is more interpretable than the
Variance for comparing spread.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- Following the previous example: $\sigma = \sqrt{4} = 2$, $s = \sqrt{\frac{32}{7}} \approx 2.14$.
- Two machines produce rods of length $10$ cm. Machine A has $\sigma = 0.1$ cm, Machine B has $\sigma = 0.5$ cm. Machine A is more precise.

## Grouped Data

When data is presented in a **grouped frequency distribution**, individual values are not available.
We work with class intervals instead.

### Key Definitions

- **Class boundaries**: The endpoints of each class interval, with no gaps between consecutive
  classes. For example, if raw intervals are $10$--$19$ and $20$--$29$The class boundaries are
  $9.5$--$19.5$ and $19.5$--$29.5$.
- **Class width**: The difference between the upper and lower class boundaries.
- **Class mark (midpoint)**: $x_i = \dfrac{\mathrm{lower boundary} + \mathrm{upper boundary}}{2}$
  used as the representative value for all data in the class.

### Mean of Grouped Data

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $k$ is the number of classes, $f_i$ is the frequency of class $i$And $x_i$ is the class Mark.

### Assumed Mean Method (Coding Method)

When class marks are equally spaced, let $h$ be the common class width and $A$ be the class mark of
A convenient class (the assumed mean). Define $d_i = \dfrac{x_i - A}{h}$. Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \bar{x} = A + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i d_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i} \times h
\end{aligned}
$$

This method simplifies calculation by working with small integer values of $d_i$.

</details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- The following frequency distribution records the marks of $40$ students:

| Class interval | $f_i$ | Class mark $x_i$ | $d_i$ | $f_i d_i$ |
| -------------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----- | --------- |
| 30 -- 39       | 4     | 34.5             | $-2$  | $-8$      |
| 40 -- 49       | 8     | 44.5             | $-1$  | $-8$      |
| 50 -- 59       | 14    | 54.5             | $0$   | $0$       |
| 60 -- 69       | 10    | 64.5             | $1$   | $10$      |
| 70 -- 79       | 4     | 74.5             | $2$   | $8$       |

Here $A = 54.5$, $h = 10$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \bar{x} &= 54.5 + \frac{-8-8+0+10+8}{40} \times 10 \\
 &= 54.5 + \frac{2}{40} \times 10 \\
 &= 54.5 + 0.5 = 55
\end{aligned}
$$

### Variance of Grouped Data

For grouped data, the population variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i}
\end{aligned}
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\left[\sum f_i x_i^2 - \frac{1}{n}\left(\sum f_i x_i\right)^2\right], \quad n = \sum f_i
\end{aligned}
$$

### Histogram Estimation

In a histogram, the area of each bar represents the frequency of the corresponding class. If class
Widths are unequal, the height of each bar is the **frequency density**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \mathrm{Frequency density} = \frac{\mathrm{Frequency}}{\mathrm{Class width}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The median, quartiles, and other percentiles can be estimated from a cumulative frequency curve
(ogive) by linear interpolation within the relevant class.

## Properties of Variance

### Linear Transformation

For a dataset $X$ and constants $a, b$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \mathrm{Var}(aX + b) = a^2 \mathrm{Var}(X)
\end{aligned}
$$

Adding a constant $b$ shifts all values equally and does not affect spread. Multiplying by $a$
Scales the spread by $|a|$.

For the mean: $\overline{aX+b} = a\bar{x} + b$.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- If $\bar{x} = 50$ and $\sigma^2 = 16$Then for $Y = 3X - 4$: $\bar{y} = 3(50)-4 = 146$ and $\mathrm{Var}(Y) = 9 \times 16 = 144$.
- Temperatures recorded in Celsius have mean $25$ and standard deviation $3$. In Fahrenheit ($F = 1.8C + 32$): mean $= 1.8(25)+32 = 77$Standard deviation $= 1.8 \times 3 = 5.4$.

### Combined Variance

Given two datasets $X$ and $Y$ with sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$Means $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$And
Variances $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$The **combined variance** of the pooled dataset is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma_c^2 = \frac{n_1 \sigma_1^2 + n_2 \sigma_2^2 + n_1(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_c)^2 + n_2(\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_c)^2}{n_1 + n_2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where the combined mean is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \bar{x}_c = \frac{n_1 \bar{x}_1 + n_2 \bar{x}_2}{n_1 + n_2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The additional terms $n_1(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_c)^2$ and $n_2(\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_c)^2$ account for
The between-group variation caused by the difference in means.

</details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- Group A: $n_1 = 6$$\bar{x}_1 = 10$$\sigma_1^2 = 4$.
- Group B: $n_2 = 4$$\bar{x}_2 = 20$$\sigma_2^2 = 9$.

Combined mean: $\bar{x}_c = \frac{6(10)+4(20)}{10} = 14$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma_c^2 &= \frac{6(4) + 4(9) + 6(10-14)^2 + 4(20-14)^2}{10} \\
 &= \frac{24 + 36 + 96 + 144}{10} = \frac{300}{10} = 30
\end{aligned}
$$

## Applications

### Coefficient of Variation

The **coefficient of variation (CV)** allows comparison of variability between datasets measured in
Different units or with vastly different means:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \mathrm{CV} = \frac{\sigma}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%
\end{aligned}
$$

A larger CV indicates greater relative dispersion.

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- Investment A: mean return $= 8\%$Standard deviation $= 2\%$. CV $= \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = 25\%$.
- Investment B: mean return $= 15\%$Standard deviation $= 5\%$. CV $= \frac{5}{15} \times 100\% \approx 33.3\%$.
- Investment A has lower relative risk.

### Box-and-Whisker Plots

A **box-and-whisker plot** is a standardised graphical display of the five-number summary: minimum,
$Q_1$$Q_2$ (median), $Q_3$And maximum.

**Construction:**

1. Draw a rectangular box from $Q_1$ to $Q_3$.
2. Draw a line inside the box at $Q_2$.
3. Extend "whiskers" to the minimum and maximum values.

**Identifying outliers:** A data point is considered a potential outlier if it falls below
$Q_1 - 1.5 \times \mathrm{IQR}$ or above $Q_3 + 1.5 \times \mathrm{IQR}$.

</details>
<summary>Examples</summary>
- Dataset: $\{5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 28, 35, 42, 58\}$ ($n=11$).
 - $Q_2 = 18$.
 - Lower half: $\{5, 8, 12, 15, 18\}$$Q_1 = 12$.
 - Upper half: $\{18, 20, 24, 28, 35, 42, 58\}$$Q_3 = 28$.
 - IQR $= 28 - 12 = 16$.
 - Lower fence: $12 - 1.5(16) = -12$.
 - Upper fence: $28 + 1.5(16) = 52$.
 - Since $58 > 52$The value $58$ is an outlier. The upper whisker extends to $42$ instead.

### Skewness (DSE awareness)

While not computed algebraically in the compulsory syllabus, students should recognise:

- **Positively skewed**: mean $>$ median, the right tail is longer.
- **Negatively skewed**: mean $<$ median, the left tail is longer.
- **Symmetrical**: mean $=$ median $=$ mode (for unimodal distributions).

Transformed dataset $Y = \dfrac{X - 20}{6}$.
</details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{6}(20) - \frac{20}{6} = \frac{20-20}{6} = 0$.
- $\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 \times 36 = \frac{1}{36} \times 36 = 1$.

3. **Question:** For the grouped frequency distribution below, find the mean and standard deviation
   using the coding method.

| Class    | Frequency |
| -------- | --------- |
| 10 -- 19 | 5         |
| 20 -- 29 | 12        |
| 30 -- 39 | 18        |
| 40 -- 49 | 10        |
| 50 -- 59 | 5         |

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Class marks: $14.5, 24.5, 34.5, 44.5, 54.5$. Let $A = 34.5$$h = 10$.
- $d_i$: $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$.
- $\sum f_i = 50$$\sum f_i d_i = 5(-2) + 12(-1) + 18(0) + 10(1) + 5(2) = -10 + (-12) + 0 + 10 + 10 = -2$.
- $\bar{x} = 34.5 + \frac{-2}{50} \times 10 = 34.5 - 0.4 = 34.1$.
- $\sum f_i d_i^2 = 5(4) + 12(1) + 18(0) + 10(1) + 5(4) = 20 + 12 + 0 + 10 + 20 = 62$.
- $\sigma_d^2 = \frac{62}{50} - \left(\frac{-2}{50}\right)^2 = 1.24 - 0.0016 = 1.2384$.
- $\sigma^2 = 1.2384 \times 10^2 = 123.84$. So $\sigma = \sqrt{123.84} \approx 11.13$.

4. **Question:** Two classes sat the same test. Class A ($n_1 = 30$$\bar{x}_1 = 72$ $\sigma_1 = 8$).
Class B ($n_2 = 20$$\bar{x}_2 = 80$$\sigma_2 = 6$). Find the combined mean and Combined standard
deviation.
</details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Combined mean:
  $\bar{x}_c = \frac{30(72)+20(80)}{50} = \frac{2160+1600}{50} = \frac{3760}{50} = 75.2$.
- Combined variance:
  $, $
  \begin{aligned}
  \sigma_c^2 &= \frac{30(64) + 20(36) + 30(72-75.2)^2 + 20(80-75.2)^2}{50} \\
  &= \frac{1920 + 720 + 30(10.24) + 20(23.04)}{50} \\
  &= \frac{1920 + 720 + 307.2 + 460.8}{50} \\
  &= \frac{3408}{50} = 68.16
  \end{aligned}
  $,
  $
- Combined standard deviation: $\sigma_c = \sqrt{68.16} \approx 8.26$.

6. **Question:** A farmer records the yields (in kg) of two varieties of wheat over several seasons.
Variety A: mean $= 45$Standard deviation $= 5$. Variety B: mean $= 60$Standard deviation $= 9$.
Which variety has more consistent yield?
</details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- CV$_A = \frac{5}{45} \times 100\% \approx 11.1\%$.
- CV$_B = \frac{9}{60} \times 100\% = 15.0\%$.
- Since CV$_A <$ CV$_B$Variety A has more consistent (less variable) yield relative to its mean.

- $\sigma^2 = \frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{3} - \bar{x}^2 = 8$.
- $\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{3} - 100 = 8 \implies a^2+b^2+c^2 = 324$.

8. **Question:** A set of $20$ numbers has mean $15$ and standard deviation $3$. If each number is
Multiplied by $2$ and then $5$ is added, find the new mean and new standard deviation.
</details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- New mean: $2(15) + 5 = 35$.
- New variance: $2^2 \times 3^2 = 36$.
- New standard deviation: $\sqrt{36} = 6$.

9. **Question:** The histogram below (described verbally) shows the distribution of weights of $50$
   apples. The class intervals and frequencies are:

| Weight (g) | Frequency |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 100 -- 119 | 6         |
| 120 -- 139 | 14        |
| 140 -- 159 | 20        |
| 160 -- 179 | 8         |
| 180 -- 199 | 2         |

Estimate the median weight from the cumulative frequency distribution.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Cumulative frequencies: $6, 20, 40, 48, 50$.
- The median is the $\frac{50}{2} = 25$Th value, which lies in the class $140$--$159$ (cumulative
  $20$ to $40$).
- Using linear interpolation within the class:
  $, $
  \begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{Median} &= 139.5 + \frac{25-20}{40-20} \times (159.5 - 139.5) \\
  &= 139.5 + \frac{5}{20} \times 20 \\
  &= 139.5 + 5 = 144.5 \mathrm{ g}
  \end{aligned}
  $,
  $

11. **Question:** The weekly wages (in dollars) of $8$ workers in a small factory are
$3200, 3500, 3800, 4200, 4500, 4800, 5200, 12000$. The factory owner claims the average wage is
`USD 5150`. Is this claim misleading? Explain using an appropriate measure of central tendency and
Dispersion.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{41200}{8} = 5150$. The owner's figure is arithmetically correct.
- Sorted: $\{3200, 3500, 3800, 4200, 4500, 4800, 5200, 12000\}$.
- Median: $\frac{4200+4500}{2} = 4350$.
- The median ($4350$) is a far more representative measure here. The single extreme value of
  `USD 12000` (likely the owner's own salary or a manager's) inflates the mean by `USD 800`. The
  median is resistant to outliers and better reflects what a typical worker earns.
- The range ($12000 - 3200 = 8800$) and the large gap between the mean and median both indicate
  Significant skewness, confirming the mean is a poor choice of summary statistic.

12. **Question:** A set of data has variance $25$ and mean $0$. A new set is formed by removing the
Value $10$ from the original set. If the original set had $n = 6$ values, find the new mean and new
Variance.
</details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Original: $\bar{x} = 0$$\sigma^2 = 25$$n = 6$.
- $\sum x_i = 0$So $\sum x_i^2 = n\sigma^2 + \frac{(\sum x_i)^2}{n} = 6(25) + 0 = 150$.
- After removing $10$: new sum $= 0 - 10 = -10$New $n' = 5$.
- New mean: $\bar{x}' = \frac{-10}{5} = -2$.
- New sum of squares: $150 - 100 = 50$.
- New variance: $\sigma'^2 = \frac{50}{5} - (-2)^2 = 10 - 4 = 6$.

## DSE Exam Technique

### Showing Working

For ./4-statistics-and-probability/2_statistics problems in DSE Paper 1:

1. When computing the mean, show the sum divided by $n$ before giving the decimal.
2. When computing variance, use the computational formula
   $\sigma^2 = \dfrac{\sum x_i^2}{n} - \bar{x}^2$ and show both terms.
3. For grouped data, show the class marks and the coding method in a table.
4. For the coding method, state the assumed mean $A$ and class width $h$.
5. For box plots, label all five values (min, $Q_1$$Q_2$$Q_3$Max).

### Significant Figures

The DSE requires answers to be given to 3 significant figures unless the question specifies
otherwise. Exact fractions are preferred when they arise .

### Common DSE Question Types

1. **Combined mean and variance** of two groups.
2. **Grouped data** mean and standard deviation using the coding method.
3. **Effect of linear transformations** on mean and variance.
4. **Box-and-whisker plots** with outlier identification.
5. **Coefficient of variation** for comparing relative dispersion.

## Additional Worked Examples

**Worked Example 13: Effect of adding a data point**

A dataset $\{2, 5, 8, 11, 14\}$ has mean $\bar{x} = 8$ and variance $\sigma^2 = 20$. Find the new
mean and variance if the value $20$ is added.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

New $n' = 6$. New sum $= 40 + 20 = 60$. New mean $\bar{x}' = \dfrac{60}{6} = 10$.

$\sum x_i^2 = 4 + 25 + 64 + 121 + 196 = 410$. New $\sum x_i^2 = 410 + 400 = 810$.

New variance: $\sigma'^2 = \dfrac{810}{6} - 10^2 = 135 - 100 = 35$.

**Worked Example 14: Standardised scores**

In an exam, the mean is 60 and the standard deviation is 10. Student A scores 75 and Student B
scores 55. Express each score as a standardised score (z-score).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$$z_A = \frac{75 - 60}{10} = 1.5$$

$$z_B = \frac{55 - 60}{10} = -0.5$$

Student A scored 1.5 standard deviations above the mean; Student B scored 0.5 standard deviations
below.

**Worked Example 15: Finding data from summary ./4-statistics-and-probability/2_statistics**

A dataset of 5 positive integers has mean 6 and variance 4. Find all possible datasets.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$\sum x_i = 30$ and $\dfrac{\sum x_i^2}{5} - 36 = 4 \implies \sum x_i^2 = 200$.

We need five positive integers summing to 30 with squares summing to 200.

If the data is symmetric around 6: try $\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$.

Sum $= 30$. $\sum x_i^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 = 190 \neq 200$.

Try $\{2, 6, 6, 6, 10\}$: sum $= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 4 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 100 = 212 \neq 200$.

Try $\{4, 4, 6, 8, 8\}$: sum $= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 16 + 16 + 36 + 64 + 64 = 196 \neq 200$.

Try $\{3, 5, 7, 7, 8\}$: sum $= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 9 + 25 + 49 + 49 + 64 = 196 \neq 200$.

Try $\{4, 4, 8, 6, 8\}$: sum $= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 16 + 16 + 64 + 36 + 64 = 196$.

Try $\{2, 6, 6, 8, 8\}$: sum $= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 4 + 36 + 36 + 64 + 64 = 204$.

Try $\{4, 6, 6, 6, 8\}$: sum $= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 16 + 36 + 36 + 36 + 64 = 188$.

There may be no solution with 5 positive integers. Let me try $\{2, 5, 7, 7, 9\}$: sum
$= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 4 + 25 + 49 + 49 + 81 = 208$.

$\{3, 5, 6, 8, 8\}$: sum $= 30$$\sum x_i^2 = 9 + 25 + 36 + 64 + 64 = 198$.

$\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$: $\sum x_i^2 = 190$. Need 200. The deficit is 10. If we change 5 to 6 and 6 to
5: $\{4, 6, 5, 7, 8\}$: same sum of squares.

If we change 4 to 5 and 8 to 7: $\{5, 5, 6, 7, 7\}$: $\sum x_i^2 = 25 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 49 = 184$.

The minimum $\sum x_i^2$ for sum 30 with 5 positive integers is achieved by values closest to 6.

The constraints may not be satisfiable with integers. In an exam, this would be solved numerically.

**Worked Example 16: Grouped data variance with coding**

For the frequency distribution below, find the standard deviation using the assumed mean method.

| Class    | Frequency |
| -------- | --------- |
| 5 -- 9   | 3         |
| 10 -- 14 | 7         |
| 15 -- 19 | 12        |
| 20 -- 24 | 5         |
| 25 -- 29 | 3         |

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Class marks: $7$$12$$17$$22$$27$. $A = 17$$h = 5$.

$d_i$: $-2$$-1$$0$$1$$2$.

| $f_i$ | $d_i$ | $f_id_i$ | $f_id_i^2$ |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| 3     | $-2$  | $-6$     | 12         |
| 7     | $-1$  | $-7$     | 7          |
| 12    | 0     | 0        | 0          |
| 5     | 1     | 5        | 5          |
| 3     | 2     | 6        | 12         |

$n = 30$$\sum f_id_i = -2$$\sum f_id_i^2 = 36$.

$\bar{d} = \dfrac{-2}{30} = -\dfrac{1}{15}$.

$\sigma_d^2 = \dfrac{36}{30} - \left(-\dfrac{1}{15}\right)^2 = 1.2 - \dfrac{1}{225} = \dfrac{269}{225}$.

$\sigma^2 = \dfrac{269}{225} \times 25 = \dfrac{269}{9} \approx 29.89$.

$\sigma = \sqrt{\dfrac{269}{9}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{269}}{3} \approx 5.47$.

## DSE Exam-Style Questions

**DSE Practice 1.** Two groups of students took the same test. Group A:
$n_1 = 40$$\bar{x}_1 = 65$$\sigma_1 = 8$. Group B: $n_2 = 60$$\bar{x}_2 = 72$$\sigma_2 = 10$. Find
the overall mean and standard deviation.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Combined mean: $\bar{x}_c = \dfrac{40(65) + 60(72)}{100} = \dfrac{2600 + 4320}{100} = 69.2$.

Combined variance:

$$\sigma_c^2 = \frac{40(64) + 60(100) + 40(65 - 69.2)^2 + 60(72 - 69.2)^2}{100}$$

$$= \frac{2560 + 6000 + 40(17.64) + 60(7.84)}{100}$$

$$= \frac{8560 + 705.6 + 470.4}{100} = \frac{9736}{100} = 97.36$$

$$\sigma_c = \sqrt{97.36} \approx 9.87$$

</details>

**DSE Practice 2.** The heights (in cm) of 8 students are: 158, 162, 165, 168, 170, 172, 175, 180.
After converting to feet (1 cm = 0.03281 ft), find the mean and standard deviation in feet.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Let $Y = 0.03281X$. Then $\bar{y} = 0.03281\bar{x}$ and $\sigma_Y = 0.03281\sigma_X$.

$\bar{x} = \dfrac{158 + 162 + 165 + 168 + 170 + 172 + 175 + 180}{8} = \dfrac{1350}{8} = 168.75$ cm.

$\bar{y} = 0.03281 \times 168.75 \approx 5.537$ ft.

$\sigma_X = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum x_i^2}{8} - 168.75^2}$.

$\sum x_i^2 = 24964 + 26244 + 27225 + 28224 + 28900 + 29584 + 30625 + 32400 = 228166$.

$\sigma_X^2 = \dfrac{228166}{8} - 28476.5625 = 28520.75 - 28476.5625 = 44.1875$.

$\sigma_X = \sqrt{44.1875} \approx 6.647$ cm.

$\sigma_Y = 0.03281 \times 6.647 \approx 0.2181$ ft.

</details>

**DSE Practice 3.** For the dataset $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13\}$Find the mean deviation (mean
absolute deviation) and compare it with the standard deviation.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$\bar{x} = \dfrac{49}{7} = 7$.

Mean deviation
$= \dfrac{|1-7| + |3-7| + |5-7| + |7-7| + |9-7| + |11-7| + |13-7|}{7} = \dfrac{6 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 + 6}{7} = \dfrac{24}{7} \approx 3.43$.

$\sigma^2 = \dfrac{1 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 81 + 121 + 169}{7} - 49 = \dfrac{455}{7} - 49 = 65 - 49 = 16$.

$\sigma = 4$.

The standard deviation (4) is greater than the mean deviation (3.43), which is always the case for
datasets that are not constant.

</details>

**DSE Practice 4.** A set of data has $\bar{x} = 50$ and $\sigma = 4$. If every value is increased
by $k$The new standard deviation becomes 10. Find $k$ and explain your answer.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Adding a constant $k$ does not change the standard deviation. Therefore, the new standard deviation
should still be $\sigma = 4$Not $10$.

There is no value of $k$ that changes the standard deviation from 4 to 10 by addition alone. To
change the standard deviation, we would need to multiply by a constant. If $Y = aX + b$Then
$\sigma_Y = |a|\sigma_X$. For $\sigma_Y = 10$: $|a| = \dfrac{10}{4} = 2.5$.

The question likely intends a multiplication, not just addition. If $Y = 2.5X + k$Then
$\sigma_Y = 10$ for any $k$.

**DSE Practice 5.** The table shows the distribution of marks in a test.

| Marks     | Frequency |
| --------- | --------- |
| 0 -- 19   | 4         |
| 20 -- 39  | 10        |
| 40 -- 59  | 22        |
| 60 -- 79  | 14        |
| 80 -- 100 | 5         |

Estimate the mean and standard deviation.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Class marks: $9.5$, $29.5$, $49.5$, $69.5$, $89.5$. Class widths: 20, 20, 20, 20, 21.

For the coding method with equal class widths (using width 20): $A = 49.5$, $h = 20$.

$d_i$: $-2$, $-1$, $0$, $1$, $2$ (approximately; the last class has width 21).

Using approximate equal widths:

| $f_i$ | $x_i$ | $d_i$ | $f_id_i$ | $f_id_i^2$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| 4     | 9.5   | $-2$  | $-8$     | 16         |
| 10    | 29.5  | $-1$  | $-10$    | 10         |
| 22    | 49.5  | 0     | 0        | 0          |
| 14    | 69.5  | 1     | 14       | 14         |
| 5     | 89.5  | 2     | 10       | 20         |

$n = 55$$\sum f_id_i = 6$$\sum f_id_i^2 = 60$.

$\bar{x} = 49.5 + \dfrac{6}{55} \times 20 = 49.5 + 2.18 = 51.68 \approx 51.7$.

$\sigma_d^2 = \dfrac{60}{55} - \left(\dfrac{6}{55}\right)^2 = 1.0909 - 0.0119 = 1.079$.

$\sigma^2 = 1.079 \times 400 = 431.6$. $\sigma = \sqrt{431.6} \approx 20.8$.

</details>

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing population and sample standard deviation.** The population SD divides by $N$; the
  sample SD divides by $n - 1$ (Bessel's correction). **Fix:** Check the question wording:
  "population" or "estimate from a sample."
- **Forgetting that standard deviation is always non-negative.** $\sigma \geq 0$, with $\sigma = 0$
  only when all values are identical. **Fix:** If your calculation gives a negative value, check for
  arithmetic errors.
- **Wrong formula for grouped data variance.** Use
  $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum f x^2}{\sum f} - \bar{x}^2$ for grouped data with class midpoints. **Fix:**
  Use midpoints $x$ and frequencies $f$; do not use class boundaries directly.

## Summary

- Mean $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$; variance $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}$;
  standard deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$.
- Computational formula: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2}{n} - \bar{x}^2$.
- For grouped data: use class midpoints and frequencies.
- Sample variance uses $n - 1$ in the denominator (Bessel's correction).

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Calculating mean and standard deviation

**Problem.** Find the mean and standard deviation of: $4, 7, 8, 10, 11$.

**Solution.** $\bar{x} = \frac{4+7+8+10+11}{5} = \frac{40}{5} = 8$.

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{(4-8)^2 + (7-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (10-8)^2 + (11-8)^2}{5} = \frac{16 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 9}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6$$

$$\sigma = \sqrt{6} \approx 2.45$$

$\blacksquare$

### Example 2: Grouped data

**Problem.** Find the mean and variance of the following grouped data:

| Class | Frequency |
| ----- | --------- |
| 0–10  | 3         |
| 10–20 | 7         |
| 20–30 | 5         |

**Solution.** Midpoints: $x = 5, 15, 25$. Frequencies: $f = 3, 7, 5$. Total: $n = 15$.

$\bar{x} = \frac{3(5) + 7(15) + 5(25)}{15} = \frac{15 + 105 + 125}{15} = \frac{245}{15} = \frac{49}{3}$.

$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum fx^2}{n} - \bar{x}^2 = \frac{3(25) + 7(225) + 5(625)}{15} - \left(\frac{49}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4655}{15} - \frac{2401}{9} = \frac{931}{3} - \frac{2401}{9} = \frac{2793 - 2401}{9} = \frac{392}{9} pprox 43.6$.

$\blacksquare$
