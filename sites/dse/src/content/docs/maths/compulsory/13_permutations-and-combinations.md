## Factorial Notation

### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

$$n! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$$

With $0! = 1$ by convention.

### Properties

$$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$$

$$(n + 1)! = (n + 1) \times n!$$

### Worked Example 1

Simplify $\dfrac{10!}{7! \cdot 3!}$.

$$\frac{10!}{7! \cdot 3!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7!}{7! \times 6} = \frac{720}{6} = 120$$

## Permutations

### Definition

A **permutation** is an ordered arrangement of objects. The number of permutations of $r$ objects
Chosen from $n$ distinct objects:

$$P_r^n = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$

Also written as $^{n}P_r$ or $P(n, r)$.

### When Order Matters

Permutations are used when the **order** of selection matters.

### Worked Example 2

In how many ways can 5 students be arranged in a row from a class of 8?

$$P_5^8 = \frac{8!}{3!} = \frac{40320}{6} = 6720$$

### Worked Example 3

How many 4-letter arrangements can be made from the word "SMILE"?

All 5 letters are distinct: $P_4^5 = \frac{5!}{1!} = 120$.

### Permutations with Repetition

When some objects are identical, divide by the factorial of the count of each repeated object:

$$\mathrm{Arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1!\, n_2!\, \cdots\, n_k!}$$

### Worked Example 4

How many distinct arrangements of the letters in "BANANA"?

Total letters: $n = 6$With $\mathrm{A}$ appearing $3$ times, $\mathrm{N}$ appearing $2$ times, and
$\mathrm{B}$ appearing $1$ time.

$$\frac{6!}{3!\, 2!\, 1!} = \frac{720}{6 \times 2} = 60$$

### Circular Permutations

The number of ways to arrange $n$ distinct objects in a circle:

$$(n - 1)!$$

This accounts for rotational symmetry (rotating everyone does not create a new arrangement).

### Worked Example 5

In how many ways can 6 people sit around a round table?

$$(6 - 1)! = 5! = 120$$

}
</script>

## Combinations

### Definition

A **combination** is an unordered selection of objects. The number of combinations of $r$ objects
Chosen from $n$ distinct objects:

$$C_r^n = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$$

Also written as $^{n}C_r$ or $C(n, r)$.

### When Order Does Not Matter

Combinations are used when only the **group** matters, not the order of selection.

### Worked Example 6

A committee of 4 is to be chosen from 10 people. How many ways?

$$\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!\, 6!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210$$

### Relation Between Permutations and Combinations

$$P_r^n = r! \times C_r^n$$

This reflects the fact that each combination of $r$ objects can be arranged in $r!$ ways.

## Pascal"s Triangle

### Construction

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array where each entry is the sum of the two entries directly
Above it:

$$
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
& & & 1 & & & \\
& & 1 & & 1 & & \\
& 1 & & 2 & & 1 & \\
1 & & 3 & & 3 & & 1 \\
& 1 & & 4 & & 6 & & 4 & & 1
\end{array}
$$

### Connection to Combinations

The $k$-th entry (starting from $k = 0$) in row $n$ (starting from $n = 0$) is:

$$\binom{n}{k}$$

### Properties of Binomial Coefficients

**Symmetry:**

$$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n - k}$$

**Pascal's identity:**

$$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} + \binom{n - 1}{k}$$

**Row sum:**

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$$

**Alternating sum:**

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \binom{n}{k} = 0$$

### Worked Example 7

Find the coefficient of $x^3$ in the expansion of $(1 + 2x)^7$.

By the binomial theorem:

$$(1 + 2x)^7 = \sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{7}{k}(2x)^k$$

For $x^3$: $k = 3$.

Coefficient: $\binom{7}{3} \cdot 2^3 = 35 \times 8 = 280$.

## Applications

### Selection Problems

When a problem involves selecting from distinct groups, multiply the number of choices for each
Group.

### Worked Example 8

A class has 7 boys and 5 girls. In how many ways can a team of 4 be chosen with at least 2 girls?

| Girls | Boys | Ways                                                    |
| ----- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2     | 2    | $\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{7}{2} = 10 \times 21 = 210$ |
| 3     | 1    | $\binom{5}{3} \times \binom{7}{1} = 10 \times 7 = 70$   |
| 4     | 0    | $\binom{5}{4} \times \binom{7}{0} = 5 \times 1 = 5$     |

Total: $210 + 70 + 5 = 285$.

### Complementary Counting

When it is easier to count the complement and subtract:

$$\mathrm{Desired count} = \mathrm{Total} - \mathrm{Undesired}$$

### Worked Example 9

How many 5-card hands from a standard 52-card deck contain at least one ace?

Total hands: $\binom{52}{5} = 2598960$.

Hands with no ace: $\binom{48}{5} = 1712304$.

Hands with at least one ace: $2598960 - 1712304 = 886656$.

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing permutations with combinations. Ask: does the order matter? If yes, use $P_r^n$; if no,
  use $C_r^n$.
- Forgetting that $0! = 1$. This is needed in many calculations.
- In circular permutation problems, forgetting that rotations are equivalent. For $n$ objects in a
  circle, there are $(n - 1)!$ arrangements, not $n!$.
- Double-counting in selection problems. When dividing into groups, ensure each object is counted
  exactly once.
- Incorrectly applying the permutation-with-repetition formula. Only divide by factorials when
  objects are truly identical.

<summary>Wrap-up Questions</summary>

1. **Question:** Evaluate $\binom{12}{4}$.

$\binom{12}{4} = \dfrac{12!}{4!\, 8!} = \dfrac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \dfrac{11880}{24} = 495$.

1. **Question:** How many 3-digit even numbers can be formed from the digits $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
   if each digit can be used at most once?

Last digit (units) must be even: choose from $\{2, 4, 6\}$ -- 3 ways.

First digit cannot be zero (not an issue here) and must differ from the last digit: 5 remaining
Digits.

Middle digit: 4 remaining digits.

Total: $3 \times 5 \times 4 = 60$. Wait -- first digit: 5 choices (all except the chosen last
Digit). Middle digit: 4 choices (remaining). Total: $3 \times 5 \times 4 = 60$.

1. **Question:** In how many ways can 4 boys and 3 girls be arranged in a row if no two girls sit
   together?

First arrange the 4 boys: $4! = 24$ ways. This creates 5 gaps (including ends):

`_ B _ B _ B _ B _`

Choose 3 of these 5 gaps for the girls: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways. Arrange the 3 girls: $3! = 6$
Ways.

Total: $24 \times 10 \times 6 = 1440$.

1. **Question:** A committee of 5 is chosen from 4 men and 6 women. How many committees have more
   women than men?

| Women | Men | Ways                                           |
| ----- | --- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | 2   | $\binom{6}{3}\binom{4}{2} = 20 \times 6 = 120$ |
| 4     | 1   | $\binom{6}{4}\binom{4}{1} = 15 \times 4 = 60$  |
| 5     | 0   | $\binom{6}{5}\binom{4}{0} = 6 \times 1 = 6$    |

Total: $120 + 60 + 6 = 186$.

1. **Question:** Find the coefficient of $x^4$ in $(2 - 3x)^8$.

Coefficient: $\binom{8}{4}(2)^4(-3)^4 = 70 \times 16 \times 81 = 90720$.

1. **Question:** How many distinct arrangements of the letters in "MISSISSIPPI"?

Letters: M(1), I(4), S(4), P(2). Total: 11.

$$\frac{11!}{4!\, 4!\, 2!\, 1!} = \frac{39916800}{24 \times 24 \times 2} = \frac{39916800}{1152} = 34650$$

1. **Question:** Prove that $\binom{n}{r} + \binom{n}{r - 1} = \binom{n + 1}{r}$.

$\binom{n}{r} + \binom{n}{r - 1} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} + \frac{n!}{(r-1)!(n-r+1)!}$

$= \frac{n!(n - r + 1) + n! \cdot r}{r!(n - r + 1)!} = \frac{n!(n + 1)}{r!(n + 1 - r)!} = \frac{(n+1)!}{r!(n+1-r)!} = \binom{n+1}{r}$.
$\qed$

1. **Question:** A box contains 6 red, 4 blue, and 5 green balls. In how many ways can 4 balls be
   chosen so that at least 2 are red?

Total: $\binom{15}{4} = 1365$.

With 0 or 1 red: $\binom{9}{4} + \binom{6}{1}\binom{9}{3} = 126 + 6 \times 84 = 126 + 504 = 630$.

At least 2 red: $1365 - 630 = 735$.

1. **Question:** How many ways can 8 people be divided into 4 pairs?

Number of ways to split $2n$ people into $n$ unordered pairs:

$$\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \cdot n!} = \frac{8!}{2^4 \cdot 4!} = \frac{40320}{16 \times 24} = \frac{40320}{384} = 105$$

1. **Question:** From 7 men and 5 women, how many committees of 6 can be formed with at least 3 men
    and at least 2 women?

Possible compositions: (4M, 2W), (3M, 3W).

$(4\mathrm{M}, 2\mathrm{W})$: $\binom{7}{4}\binom{5}{2} = 35 \times 10 = 350$.

$(3\mathrm{M}, 3\mathrm{W})$: $\binom{7}{3}\binom{5}{3} = 35 \times 10 = 350$.

Total: $350 + 350 = 700$.

## Additional Worked Examples

**Worked Example 10: Arrangements with repeated letters**

How many distinct arrangements of the letters in "MATHEMATICS"?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Total letters: $11$. Counts: M($2$), A($2$), T($2$), H($1$), E($1$), I($1$), C($1$), S($1$).

$$\frac{11!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{39916800}{8} = 4989600$$

</details>

**Worked Example 11: Couple seating arrangements**

In how many ways can 4 married couples sit in a row of 8 seats if each couple must sit together?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Treat each couple as a single unit. We have 4 units to arrange: $4! = 24$ ways.

Each couple can swap seats internally: $2^4 = 16$ ways.

$$24 \times 16 = 384$$

</details>

**Worked Example 12: Distributing identical objects (stars and bars)**

In how many ways can 12 identical balls be distributed into 5 distinct boxes (boxes may be empty)?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

This is a stars-and-bars problem: we need the number of non-negative integer solutions to
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 12$.

$$\binom{12 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \binom{16}{4} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1820$$

</details>

**Worked Example 13: Password with digit constraint**

A password consists of 4 distinct characters chosen from $\{A, B, C, D, E, 1, 2, 3\}$. How many
passwords contain at least one digit?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Total passwords (no repetition): $P_4^8 = \dfrac{8!}{4!} = 1680$.

Passwords with no digits (all letters from 5 letters): $P_4^5 = \dfrac{5!}{1!} = 120$.

$$1680 - 120 = 1560$$

**Direct counting verification:**

| Digits | Letters | Ways                                                              |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | 3       | $\binom{3}{1}\binom{5}{3} \cdot 4! = 3 \times 10 \times 24 = 720$ |
| 2      | 2       | $\binom{3}{2}\binom{5}{2} \cdot 4! = 3 \times 10 \times 24 = 720$ |
| 3      | 1       | $\binom{3}{3}\binom{5}{1} \cdot 4! = 1 \times 5 \times 24 = 120$  |

Total: $720 + 720 + 120 = 1560$. Correct.

</details>

**Worked Example 14: Constant term in a binomial expansion**

Find the constant term in the expansion of $\left(x^2 + \dfrac{2}{x}\right)^6$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

General term:
$\binom{6}{k}(x^2)^{6-k}\!\left(\dfrac{2}{x}\right)^k = \binom{6}{k} \cdot 2^k \cdot x^{12-2k-k} = \binom{6}{k} \cdot 2^k \cdot x^{12-3k}$.

For the constant term: $12 - 3k = 0 \implies k = 4$.

$$\binom{6}{4} \cdot 2^4 = 15 \times 16 = 240$$

## Additional Common Pitfalls

1. **Order matters vs. Does not matter.** "Arranging" implies permutations (order matters).
   "Selecting" or "choosing" implies combinations (order does not matter). When in doubt, ask
   whether swapping two elements produces a different outcome.

2. **Overcounting in selection problems.** When forming teams from distinct groups, multiply the
   number of ways from each group. Do not use $\binom{n}{r}$ on the combined pool, which ignores
   group structure.

3. **Circular permutation exceptions.** If a circle has a fixed reference point (e.g., a specific
   seat for a host), the arrangement count changes. With $n$ people and one fixed seat, the
   remaining $n-1$ people are arranged linearly in $(n-1)!$ ways.

4. **Stars and bars conditions.** $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$ counts non-negative integer solutions. For
   strictly positive solutions (at least one per box), substitute $y_i = x_i - 1$ to get
   $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.

5. **Binomial theorem sign errors.** In $(a - b)^n$The general term is
   $(-1)^k \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$. The alternating sign $(-1)^k$ is frequently forgotten.

6. **Division into equal indistinguishable groups.** When dividing $2n$ people into two teams of
   $n$The answer is $\dfrac{1}{2}\binom{2n}{n}$Not $\binom{2n}{n}$Since the two teams are not
   labelled.

7. **Double-counting in circular arrangements with identical objects.** In circular permutations
   with repeated items, apply both the circular correction ($(n-1)!$) and the identical-objects
   correction (dividing by factorials of counts).

8. **Confusing $P_r^n$ notation with $C_r^n$.** Always verify whether the problem requires ordered
   or unordered selection before choosing the formula. A safe check: if the problem asks "how many
   ways to arrange" use $P$; if it asks "how many ways to choose" use $C$.

## Exam-Style Problems

**Problem 1.** A debating team of 4 is to be selected from 6 boys and 5 girls. The team must include
at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl. In how many ways can this be done?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Total teams of 4 from 11 people: $\binom{11}{4} = 330$.

All-boy teams: $\binom{6}{4} = 15$. All-girl teams: $\binom{5}{4} = 5$.

$$330 - 15 - 5 = 310$$

</details>

**Problem 2.** How many 5-digit numbers greater than $40000$ can be formed from
$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ if no digit is repeated?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The first digit must be $4$, $5$, $6$Or $7$: $4$ choices.

The remaining 4 positions are filled from the remaining $6$ digits without repetition:
$P_4^6 = \dfrac{6!}{2!} = 360$.

$$4 \times 360 = 1440$$

</details>

**Problem 3.** Find the coefficient of $x^5$ in the expansion of $(1 - 2x)^8$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

General term: $\binom{8}{k}(-2x)^k = (-1)^k \cdot 2^k \cdot \binom{8}{k} \cdot x^k$.

For $x^5$: $k = 5$.

$$(-1)^5 \cdot 2^5 \cdot \binom{8}{5} = -32 \times 56 = -1792$$

</details>

**Problem 4.** In how many ways can 3 boys and 3 girls sit around a circular table if no two boys
sit next to each other?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

First, seat the 3 girls around the circular table: $(3-1)! = 2! = 2$ ways.

This creates $3$ gaps between the girls. Place the $3$ boys into these $3$ gaps: $3! = 6$ ways.

$$2 \times 6 = 12$$

</details>

**Problem 5.** A shelf holds 6 different maths books and 4 different physics books. In how many ways
can the books be arranged if all books of the same subject must stay together?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Treat each subject group as a block: $2$ blocks, arranged in $2! = 2$ ways.

Within the maths block: $6! = 720$ ways.

Within the physics block: $4! = 24$ ways.

$$2 \times 720 \times 24 = 34560$$

</details>

**Problem 6.** Find the number of ways to place 8 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes
such that no box is empty.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Use inclusion-exclusion.

Total placements: $3^8 = 6561$.

Placements with at least one box empty:

- Exactly 1 specific box empty: $2^8 = 256$. For $3$ boxes: $3 \times 256 = 768$.
- Exactly 2 specific boxes empty: $1^8 = 1$. For $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs: $3 \times 1 = 3$.

$$6561 - 768 + 3 = 5796$$

</details>

**Problem 7.** How many ways can 6 people be divided into 3 groups of 2?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Choose 2 from 6: $\binom{6}{2} = 15$. Choose 2 from remaining 4: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$. The last 2 are
fixed: $\binom{2}{2} = 1$.

Since the 3 groups are indistinguishable (no labelling), divide by $3!$:

$$\frac{15 \times 6 \times 1}{6} = 15$$

Alternatively: $\dfrac{6!}{2^3 \cdot 3!} = \dfrac{720}{48} = 15$. Correct.

</details>

**Problem 8.** How many distinct arrangements of the letters in "SUCCESS" have the two C's
separated?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Total arrangements of "SUCCESS": $\dfrac{7!}{3! \cdot 2!} = \dfrac{5040}{12} = 420$.

Arrangements with the two C's adjacent: treat "CC" as one unit. We have 6 units: S($3$), "CC"($1$),
U($1$), E($1$).

$$\frac{6!}{3!} = \frac{720}{6} = 120$$

$$420 - 120 = 300$$

## DSE Exam Technique

### Showing Working

In DSE Maths Paper 2 (MC) you select the answer; in Paper 1 you must show full working. For counting
problems, examiners expect:

1. State whether order matters (permutation vs combination).
2. For casework, label each case and sum at the end.
3. For complementary counting, explicitly state the total and the complement.
4. Write the formula before substituting values, e.g., $\binom{n}{r} = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.

### Significant Figures

Final numerical answers should be given to 3 significant figures unless the question specifies
otherwise. Intermediate combinatorial values (factorials, binomial coefficients) are exact integers
and must not be rounded.

### Common DSE Question Types

1. **Arrangement with restrictions** (gaps, adjacency, specific positions).
2. **Selection with group constraints** (at least $k$ from a group, at most $m$ from another).
3. **Binomial expansion** (coefficient of a specific term, constant term, middle term).
4. **Distributing objects into boxes** (stars and bars, inclusion-exclusion).
5. **Division into groups** (equal groups, indistinguishable groups).

## Additional Worked Examples

**Worked Example 15: Arrangements with vowel adjacency**

In how many ways can the letters of the word "EQUATION" be arranged so that all three vowels (E, U,
A, I, O -- five vowels) appear together?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The word "EQUATION" has 8 distinct letters. The vowels are E, U, A, I, O (5 letters) and the
consonants are Q, T, N (3 letters).

Treat the 5 vowels as a single block. We have 4 units to arrange: {VOWELS}, Q, T, N.

$$4! = 24$$

Within the vowel block, the 5 vowels can be arranged in $5! = 120$ ways.

$$24 \times 120 = 2880$$

</details>

**Worked Example 16: Selection with identical objects**

A box contains 4 red balls and 6 blue balls. In how many ways can 5 balls be selected if at least 3
are red?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

| Red | Blue | Ways                                                  |
| --- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 3   | 2    | $\binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{2} = 4 \times 15 = 60$ |
| 4   | 1    | $\binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{1} = 1 \times 6 = 6$   |

Total: $60 + 6 = 66$.

Note: we cannot select 5 red balls since only 4 red balls exist.

</details>

**Worked Example 17: Circular arrangement with gender alternation**

In how many ways can 4 men and 4 women sit around a round table if men and women must alternate?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

First, seat the 4 men around the table: $(4 - 1)! = 3! = 6$ ways (circular permutation).

This creates 4 gaps between the men. Place the 4 women into these 4 gaps: $4! = 24$ ways.

$$6 \times 24 = 144$$

</details>

**Worked Example 18: Number of divisors**

Find the number of positive divisors of $N = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

A divisor of $N$ has the form $2^a \times 3^b \times 5^c$ where
$0 \leq a \leq 3$$0 \leq b \leq 2$$0 \leq c \leq 1$.

Number of choices for $a$: $4$ (i.e., $0, 1, 2, 3$).

Number of choices for $b$: $3$ (i.e., $0, 1, 2$).

Number of choices for $c$: $2$ (i.e., $0, 1$).

$$4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24$$

</details>

**Worked Example 19: Binomial expansion with fractional index**

Find the first three terms in the expansion of $(1 + 2x)^{-1/2}$ in ascending powers of $x$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Using the generalised binomial theorem:

$$(1 + 2x)^{-1/2} = \binom{-1/2}{0} + \binom{-1/2}{1}(2x) + \binom{-1/2}{2}(2x)^2 + \cdots$$

$$\binom{-1/2}{0} = 1$$

$$\binom{-1/2}{1} = \frac{-1/2}{1} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

$$\binom{-1/2}{2} = \frac{(-1/2)(-3/2)}{2!} = \frac{3}{8}$$

Therefore:

$$(1 + 2x)^{-1/2} = 1 - \frac{1}{2}(2x) + \frac{3}{8}(4x^2) + \cdots = 1 - x + \frac{3}{2}x^2 + \cdots$$

</details>

**Worked Example 20: Derangement**

In how many ways can 5 letters be placed into 5 addressed envelopes so that no letter goes into the
correct envelope?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

This is a derangement problem. The number of derangements of $n$ objects is:

$$!n = n!\left(1 - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\right)$$

For $n = 5$:

$$!5 = 5!\left(1 - 1 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{120}\right) = 120 \times \frac{44}{120} = 44$$

## DSE Exam-Style Questions

**DSE Practice 1.** A committee of 5 is to be chosen from 7 men and 5 women. Find the number of ways
to select the committee if it must contain exactly 2 women and the committee must include either Mr.
A or Mr. B (or both).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Total ways with exactly 2 women: $\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{7}{3} = 10 \times 35 = 350$.

Subtract committees with neither Mr. A nor Mr. B:
$\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{5}{3} = 10 \times 10 = 100$.

$$350 - 100 = 250$$

</details>

**DSE Practice 2.** Find the coefficient of $x^3$ in the expansion of $(1 + x)(2 - x)^6$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

First expand $(2 - x)^6$ up to $x^3$:

$$(2 - x)^6 = 2^6 - \binom{6}{1}2^5 x + \binom{6}{2}2^4 x^2 - \binom{6}{3}2^3 x^3 + \cdots = 64 - 192x + 240x^2 - 160x^3 + \cdots$$

Multiply by $(1 + x)$:

$$(1 + x)(64 - 192x + 240x^2 - 160x^3) = 64 - 192x + 240x^2 - 160x^3 + 64x - 192x^2 + 240x^3 + \cdots$$

$$= 64 - 128x + 48x^2 + 80x^3 + \cdots$$

The coefficient of $x^3$ is $80$.

</details>

**DSE Practice 3.** 6 boys and 4 girls are to be seated in a row of 10 chairs. In how many ways can
they be arranged if no two girls sit next to each other and the two youngest boys must sit at the
two ends?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The two youngest boys must sit at the ends: $2! = 2$ ways.

The remaining 4 boys sit in the middle 8 positions: we choose 4 of the remaining 8 positions and
arrange the 4 boys: $\binom{8}{4} \times 4! = 70 \times 24 = 1680$.

The 4 boys in the middle create 5 gaps (including the gap between the two end boys and the first
middle boy, etc.). We need to choose 4 of these 5 gaps for the girls: $\binom{5}{4} = 5$.

Arrange the 4 girls: $4! = 24$.

$$2 \times 1680 \times 5 \times 24 = 403200$$

</details>

**DSE Practice 4.** Find the term independent of $x$ in the expansion of
$\left(x^2 + \dfrac{1}{x}\right)^3 \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{x}\right)^5$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

First factor: $\left(x^2 + \dfrac{1}{x}\right)^3$. General term:
$\binom{3}{r}(x^2)^{3-r}\!\left(\dfrac{1}{x}\right)^r = \binom{3}{r} x^{6-3r}$.

For the power of $x$ to be $k$: $k = 6 - 3r$.

- $r = 0$: $x^6$
- $r = 1$: $x^3$
- $r = 2$: $x^0$ (constant)
- $r = 3$: $x^{-3}$

Second factor: $(1 - x^{-1})^5$. General term: $\binom{5}{s}(-1)^s x^{-s}$.

We need the total power of $x$ to be 0. From the first factor, take $x^{6-3r}$; from the second,
take $(-1)^s x^{-s}$. Total power: $6 - 3r - s = 0$I.e., $s = 6 - 3r$.

Since $0 \leq s \leq 5$:

- $r = 0$: $s = 6$ (reject, $s > 5$)
- $r = 1$: $s = 3$: coefficient
  $= \binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{3}(-1)^3 = 3 \times 10 \times (-1) = -30$
- $r = 2$: $s = 0$: coefficient $= \binom{3}{2} \cdot \binom{5}{0}(-1)^0 = 3 \times 1 = 3$

Term independent of $x$: $-30 + 3 = -27$.

</details>

**DSE Practice 5.** Prove that the sum of all binomial coefficients
$\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \cdots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Consider $(1 + 1)^n$. By the binomial theorem:

$$(1 + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} 1^{n-k} \cdot 1^k = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}$$

Therefore:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n \qed$$

</details>

**DSE Practice 6.** A password consists of 4 characters. Each character is a letter (A to Z) or a
digit (0 to 9). How many passwords contain at least one digit and at least one letter, if characters
may be repeated?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Total passwords (with repetition): $36^4 = 1679616$.

All-letter passwords: $26^4 = 456976$.

All-digit passwords: $10^4 = 10000$.

Passwords with at least one digit and at least one letter:

$$1679616 - 456976 - 10000 = 1212640$$

</details>

**DSE Practice 7.** In how many ways can 12 students be divided into 3 groups of 4 to work on 3
different projects?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Choose 4 from 12 for Project 1: $\binom{12}{4} = 495$.

Choose 4 from remaining 8 for Project 2: $\binom{8}{4} = 70$.

The last 4 go to Project 3: $\binom{4}{4} = 1$.

$$495 \times 70 \times 1 = 34650$$

Note: we do NOT divide by $3!$ here because the projects are distinct (labelled), unlike the case of
indistinguishable groups.

</details>

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Arranging with restrictions

**Problem.** In how many ways can 5 boys and 3 girls sit in a row if the girls must sit together?

**Solution.** Treat the 3 girls as a single block. We have $5 + 1 = 6$ items to arrange: $6!$ ways.

Within the block, the girls can be arranged in $3!$ ways.

Total: $6! \times 3! = 720 \times 6 = 4320$.

$\blacksquare$

### Example 2: Selection problem

**Problem.** A committee of 4 is to be chosen from 7 men and 5 women. In how many ways can this be
done if the committee must include at least 2 women?

**Solution.** Cases: 2 women + 2 men, or 3 women + 1 man, or 4 women.

$${}^5 C_2 \times {}^7 C_2 + {}^5 C_3 \times {}^7 C_1 + {}^5 C_4 \times {}^7 C_0 = 10 \times 21 + 10 \times 7 + 5 \times 1 = 210 + 70 + 5 = 285$$

$\blacksquare$

## Summary

- ${}^n P_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ (order matters); ${}^n C_r = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
  (order doesn't matter).
- For restrictions (e.g., items together), use the "block" method.
- For "at least" problems, either enumerate cases or use the complement: total $-$ unwanted.
- $0! = 1$; $n!$ grows extremely fast — use simplification before computing.

## Intuition

Mathematics provides the language for describing patterns, relationships, and change. Functions transform inputs to outputs like machines, calculus measures how things change and accumulate, and probability quantifies uncertainty. The power of mathematics lies in its ability to model real-world situations abstractly, allowing us to solve problems and make predictions across science, engineering, and everyday life.
