title: "Forces and Motion -- Diagnostic Tests"
description: ""s third law pairs. (c) Calculate the normal force the table
exerts on the book, and the normal force the floor exerts on the table (table mass $= 8$ kg).

**Solution:**

**(a) Free-body diagrams:**

_Book:_ Weight $W_b = mg = 2 \times 9.81 = 19.62$ N (downward), Normal force from table
$N_{t \to b}$ (upward).

_Table:_ Weight $W_t = 8 \times 9.81 = 78.48$ N (downward), Normal force from book $N_{b \to t}$
(downward) [contact force from book on table], Normal force from floor $N_{f \to t}$ (upward).

**(b) Newton's third law pairs:**

- $N_{t \to b}$ (table pushes book up) and $N_{b \to t}$ (book pushes table down) — **This is a
  pair.**
- $W_b$ (Earth pulls book down) and book pulls Earth up — **This is a pair.**
- $W_t$ (Earth pulls table down) and table pulls Earth up — **This is a pair.**

**Common misconception:** $N_{t \to b}$ and $W_b$ are NOT a third law pair. They act on the same
body (the book) and are not equal unless $a = 0$.

**(c) For the book (accelerating upward at $3 \text{ m s}^{-2}$):**

$$N_{t \to b} - W_b = m_b a$$

$$N_{t \to b} = m_b(g + a) = 2(9.81 + 3) = 25.62 \text{ N}$$

By Newton's third law: $N_{b \to t} = 25.62$ N (downward).

For the table:

$$N_{f \to t} - W_t - N_{b \to t} = m_t a$$

$$N_{f \to t} = W_t + N_{b \to t} + m_t a = 78.48 + 25.62 + 8(3) = 78.48 + 25.62 + 24 = 128.1 \text{ N}$$

### UT-2: Connected Objects with Friction on a Rough Incline

**Question:**

Block A ($5$ kg) rests on a rough horizontal surface ($\mu = 0.4$). It is connected by a light
inextensible string over a smooth pulley to block B ($3$ kg) hanging vertically. Find (a) the
acceleration of the system, (b) the tension in the string, and (c) the force exerted on the pulley
by the string.

**Solution:**

**(a) System acceleration:**

For block B (taking downward as positive):

$$m_B g - T = m_B a \quad \text{--- (1)}$$

For block A (taking rightward toward pulley as positive):

$$T - f = m_A a$$

Where $f = \mu m_A g = 0.4 \times 5 \times 9.81 = 19.62$ N

$$T - 19.62 = 5a \quad \text{--- (2)}$$

Adding (1) and (2):

$$m_B g - f = (m_A + m_B)a$$

$$3(9.81) - 19.62 = 8a$$

$$29.43 - 19.62 = 8a$$

$$a = \frac{9.81}{8} = 1.226 \text{ m s}^{-2}$$

**(b) Tension:**

From equation (1):

$$T = m_B(g - a) = 3(9.81 - 1.226) = 3(8.584) = 25.75 \text{ N}$$

**(c) Force on pulley:**

The string pulls the pulley downward with tension $T$ on both sides (vertical and horizontal). These
two tension forces are perpendicular.

$$F_{\text{pulley}} = \sqrt{T^2 + T^2} = T\sqrt{2} = 25.75 \times \sqrt{2} = 36.41 \text{ N}$$

The force on the pulley is directed at $45°$ below the horizontal, toward block A and block B.

### UT-3: Banked Curve without Friction

**Question:**

A car travels at constant speed $v$ around a banked circular curve of radius $r = 80$ m and banking
angle $\theta = 20°$. There is no friction between the tyres and the road. Find the speed at which
the car can negotiate the curve without slipping up or down the bank.

**Solution:**

The forces on the car are: weight $mg$ (downward) and normal force $N$ (perpendicular to the banked
surface). No friction acts.

Resolving forces:

**Vertically** (perpendicular to the road surface):

$$N \cos \theta = mg$$

$$N = \frac{mg}{\cos \theta}$$

**Horizontally** (toward centre of the circle):

$$N \sin \theta = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Substituting $N$:

$$\frac{mg \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

$$g \tan \theta = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

$$v = \sqrt{rg \tan \theta} = \sqrt{80 \times 9.81 \times \tan 20°}$$

$$v = \sqrt{80 \times 9.81 \times 0.3640} = \sqrt{285.8} = 16.9 \text{ m s}^{-1}$$

**Key insight:** At this specific speed, the horizontal component of the normal force alone provides
the required centripetal force. No friction is needed. If the car goes faster, it tends to slide up;
if slower, it tends to slide down.

## Integration Tests

### IT-1: Multiple Connected Bodies on Inclines (with Mechanics)

**Question:**

Block A ($4$ kg) on a smooth incline of angle $30°$ is connected by a string over a smooth pulley at
the top to block B ($6$ kg) on a rough incline of angle $45°$ on the other side ($\mu = 0.3$ between
B and its incline). The system is released from rest. Determine the direction of motion and the
acceleration.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate net driving forces for each possible direction**

_If the system moves such that A goes up the $30°$ incline and B goes down the $45°$ incline:_

Component of weight of A down the $30°$ incline: $m_A g \sin 30° = 4 \times 9.81 \times 0.5 = 19.62$
N

Component of weight of B down the $45°$ incline:
$m_B g \sin 45° = 6 \times 9.81 \times 0.7071 = 41.62$ N

Friction on B (opposes B's motion, so acts up the $45°$ incline):
$$f = \mu m_B g \cos 45° = 0.3 \times 6 \times 9.81 \times 0.7071 = 12.49 \text{ N}$$

Net force driving A up / B down: $41.62 - 12.49 - 19.62 = 9.51$ N (positive, so motion in this
direction)

_Check the other direction:_

If B goes up and A goes down, friction on B acts down the $45°$ incline:

Net force: $19.62 - (41.62 + 12.49) = -34.49$ N (negative, impossible)

**Direction:** A moves up the $30°$ incline, B moves down the $45°$ incline.

**Step 2: Acceleration**

For A (up the incline positive): $T - m_A g \sin 30° = m_A a$

$$T - 19.62 = 4a \quad \text{--- (1)}$$

For B (down the incline positive): $m_B g \sin 45° - T - f = m_B a$

$$41.62 - T - 12.49 = 6a$$

$$29.13 - T = 6a \quad \text{--- (2)}$$

Adding (1) and (2): $9.51 = 10a$

$$a = 0.951 \text{ m s}^{-2}$$

$$T = 19.62 + 4(0.951) = 23.42 \text{ N}$$

### IT-2: Tension Variation in a Whirling String (with Mechanics)

**Question:**

A light inextensible string of length $2L$ has a small mass $m$ attached at its midpoint. One end is
fixed at point A and the other at point B, where A and B are on the same horizontal level separated
by distance $L$. The system rotates about the vertical axis AB with angular speed $\omega$. Find the
tension in each half of the string in terms of $m$$\omega$$g$And $L$.

**Solution:**

Let the mass be at the midpoint M. The string forms two segments AM and BM, each of length $L$.
Since AB $= L$Triangle ABM is equilateral, so the angle each string makes with the vertical is
$30°$.

**Geometry check:** In the equilateral triangle, each side is $L$And the height of the mass below AB
is $L \cos 30° = \frac{L\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

By symmetry, both tensions are equal: $T_1 = T_2 = T$.

**Vertical equilibrium:**

$$2T \cos 30° = mg$$

$$2T \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = mg$$

$$T = \frac{mg}{\sqrt{3}}$$

**Horizontal (centripetal):**

The radius of circular motion is $r = L \sin 30° = \frac{L}{2}$.

$$2T \sin 30° = m\omega^2 r$$

$$2T \times \frac{1}{2} = m\omega^2 \left(\frac{L}{2}\right)$$

$$T = \frac{m\omega^2 L}{4}$$

**Equating both expressions for $T$:**

$$\frac{mg}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{m\omega^2 L}{4}$$

$$\omega^2 = \frac{4g}{L\sqrt{3}}$$

$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{4g}{L\sqrt{3}}}$$

And the tension:

$$T = \frac{mg}{\sqrt{3}}$$

**Key insight:** The tension simultaneously supports the weight (vertical component) and provides
centripetal force (horizontal component). Both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.

### IT-3: Friction on Accelerating Platform (with Energy and Work)

**Question:**

A parcel of mass $10$ kg rests on the flatbed of a truck. The coefficient of static friction between
the parcel and the flatbed is $0.5$. The truck accelerates from rest uniformly. What is the shortest
time in which the truck can reach a speed of $20 \text{ m s}^{-1}$ without the parcel sliding? What
is the minimum stopping distance for the truck (from $20 \text{ m s}^{-1}$) without the parcel
sliding?

**Solution:**

**Maximum acceleration without sliding:**

The friction force provides the acceleration for the parcel:

$$f_{\max} = \mu_s mg = m a_{\max}$$

$$a_{\max} = \mu_s g = 0.5 \times 9.81 = 4.905 \text{ m s}^{-2}$$

**(a) Minimum time to reach $20 \text{ m s}^{-1}$:**

$$v = u + at$$

$$20 = 0 + 4.905 \times t$$

$$t = \frac{20}{4.905} = 4.08 \text{ s}$$

**(b) Minimum stopping distance:**

When braking, friction acts forward on the parcel (opposing relative sliding tendency):

$$a_{\max} = 4.905 \text{ m s}^{-2}$$ (same magnitude, opposite direction)

$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$

$$0 = 20^2 + 2(-4.905)s$$

$$s = \frac{400}{9.81} = 40.77 \text{ m}$$

**Key insight:** The maximum frictional force limits both the maximum acceleration and the maximum
deceleration. The parcel can withstand the same magnitude of acceleration in both directions since
$$
static friction adjusts to prevent relative motion.
