# DSE Physics Diagnostic Guide

## Overview

This diagnostic system covers all 10 core topics of the HKDSE Physics examination. Each topic file
contains 3 unit tests (single-topic, testing deep understanding) and 3 integration tests
(multi-topic, testing synthesis and application). All questions target the upper difficulty band of
the DSE specification.

## Grading Rubric

### Scoring per Question

Each question is scored on a 4-level scale:

| Level              | Descriptor            | Criteria                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4 - Mastery**    | Complete and correct  | Correct final answer, valid method, appropriate units, no significant errors                 |
| **3 - Proficient** | Minor errors only     | Correct approach but arithmetic or algebraic slip; or correct answer with incomplete working |
| **2 - Developing** | Partial understanding | Correct setup of some equations but unable to complete; or conceptual error in one step      |
| **1 - Beginning**  | Significant gaps      | Wrong approach or fundamental misconception; only isolated correct elements                  |
| **0 - No attempt** | Blank or irrelevant   | No meaningful physics content                                                                |

### Diagnostic Interpretation

**Per-topic score** (out of 24: 6 questions x 4 marks each):

| Score | Band | Interpretation            | Action                                                                        |
| ----- | ---- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 22-24 | A    | Excellent mastery         | Move to integration tests of other topics; consider extension work            |
| 18-21 | B    | Good understanding        | Review missed questions; focus on specific weak spots                         |
| 12-17 | C    | Adequate foundation       | Revisit topic notes; practise with standard textbook exercises first          |
| 6-11  | D    | Significant gaps          | Study the topic from fundamentals; use worked examples as templates           |
| 0-5   | U    | Major intervention needed | Seek teacher support; start with basic concepts before attempting diagnostics |

## Common Pitfalls by Topic

### Mechanics

- Using distance instead of displacement in SUVAT equations
- Forgetting that projectile horizontal velocity is constant
- Wrong sign for $g$ when taking upward as positive
- Choosing the wrong SUVAT equation for the given unknown

### Forces and Motion

- Drawing action-reaction pairs on the same body
- Assuming normal force always equals weight
- Getting friction direction wrong (it opposes relative motion, not the applied force)
- Forgetting to include all forces in free-body diagrams

### Energy and Work

- Using $W = Fd$ instead of $W = Fd\cos\theta$ for angled forces
- Assuming conservation of energy when non-conservative forces are present
- Confusing efficiency = output/input with input/output
- Forgetting that power $= Fv$ only when $F$ and $v$ are in the same direction

### Waves and Sound

- Confusing wave speed with particle velocity
- Misidentifying longitudinal vs transverse waves
- Forgetting that standing waves require specific boundary conditions
- Using amplitude instead of frequency in the wave equation

### Optics

- Wrong sign convention in thin lens equation
- Confusing real and virtual images
- Forgetting that total internal reflection requires the ray to go from denser to less dense medium
- Incorrect magnification sign interpretation

### Waves and Optics

- Forgetting that diffraction requires gap size comparable to wavelength
- Wrong path difference conditions for constructive/destructive interference
- Assuming polarisation applies to all waves (only transverse)
- Confusing the order of the electromagnetic spectrum

### Electrical Circuits

- Confusing current direction with electron flow direction
- Mixing up EMF and terminal PD
- Wrong formula for parallel resistance ($1/R = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2$Not $R = R_1 + R_2$)
- Ignoring internal resistance in calculations

### Electricity and Magnetism

- Using the wrong hand rule (Fleming's left vs right)
- Confusing Faraday's law (magnitude) with Lenz's law (direction)
- Forgetting that back EMF reduces motor current
- Wrong transformer equation application

### Heat and Gases

- Using Celsius instead of Kelvin in gas law calculations
- Confusing specific heat capacity with latent heat
- Forgetting that $\gamma = C_p/C_v$ differs for monatomic and diatomic gases
- Incorrect adiabatic vs isothermal process identification

### Nuclear Physics

- Using $N_0$ instead of $N$ in $A = \lambda N$
- Confusing half-life with mean life
- Misinterpreting the binding energy per nucleon curve
- Forgetting that $E = mc^2$ requires mass to actually be converted (not just present)

## Study Strategy

### For students scoring Band A or B on a topic:

- Attempt the integration tests in other topics that reference this topic
- Try to create your own multi-topic problems
- Time yourself under exam conditions (approximately 12 minutes per question for DSE)

### For students scoring Band C or D on a topic:

- Return to the main topic notes and review systematically
- Work through textbook examples before retrying diagnostic questions
- Focus on understanding WHY each step works, not just memorising procedures

### For students scoring Band U on a topic:

- Start with the prerequisite topics in the chain above
- Build up from basic definitions and concepts
- Use the unit tests as learning exercises (read the solution, then attempt similar problems)
