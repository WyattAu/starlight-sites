    question: 'In a star network topology, what happens if the central hub\nor switch fails?',
    options: [
      'A) Only the directly connected devices stop communicating; other\ndevices continue to function normally',
      'B) The entire network stops functioning',
      'C) Data is\nrerouted automatically through remaining connections',
      'D) Only wireless devices are affected',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      'In a star topology, all devices connect to a single central hub or switch.\nIf the central device fails, the entire network becomes inoperative because all communication must\npass through it. However, if one peripheral device fails, only that device is affected and the rest\nof the network continues to function. This is a key advantage over bus and ring topologies.',

    question:
      'Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for routing data packets between different\nnetworks?',
    options: [
      'A) Data Link Layer (Layer 2)',
      'B) Transport Layer (Layer 4)',
      'C) Network\nLayer (Layer 3)',
      'D) Application Layer (Layer 7)',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      'The Network Layer\n(Layer 3) is responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing -- determining the best\npath for data packets to travel across multiple networks. Routers operate at this layer. The Data\nLink Layer handles node-to-node delivery on the same network. The Transport Layer ensures reliable\nend-to-end delivery. The Application Layer provides user-facing services.',

    question: 'Which of\nthe following correctly describes the TCP/IP protocol suite?',
    options: [
      'A) A single protocol for\ntransmitting data over the internet',
      'B) A collection of protocols organised into layers that\ngovern data communication on the internet',
      'C) A hardware specification for network interface\ncards',
      'D) A programming language for web development',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      'TCP/IP\n(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a suite of protocols organised into four\nlayers: Application Layer (HTTP, FTP, SMTP), Transport Layer (TCP, UDP), Internet Layer (IP, ICMP),\nand Network Access Layer (Ethernet, Wi-Fi). TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented data\ntransmission. IP handles addressing and routing. Together they form the foundation of internet\ncommunication.',

    question:
      'Which network topology connects all devices in a single continuous\ncable (trunk) and uses terminators at both ends?',
    options: ['A) Star topology', 'B) Ring\ntopology', 'C) Bus topology', 'D) Mesh topology'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      'A bus topology uses a\nsingle backbone cable (bus/trunk) to which all devices are connected. Terminators at both ends\nprevent signal reflection. Advantages: simple, cheap, easy to set up for small networks.\nDisadvantages: if the main cable fails, the entire network goes down; performance degrades as more\ndevices are added; difficult to troubleshoot. Common in early Ethernet networks (10BASE2).',
