    question:
      "A driver's reaction time is 0.8 s. When the driver sees a\nhazard while travelling at 25 m/s, what is the thinking distance?",
    options: ['A) 25 m', 'B) 12.5\nm', 'C) 20 m', 'D) 31.25 m'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      'Thinking distance = speed x reaction time =\n25 x 0.8 = 20 m. This is the distance the car travels before the driver begins braking.',

  {
    question:
      'Which of the following factors increases the braking distance but NOT the thinking\ndistance?',
    options: ['A) Higher speed', 'B) Worn tyres', 'C) Alcohol consumption', 'D) Wet road\nsurface'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      'Worn tyres reduce friction between tyres and road, increasing\nbraking distance. Higher speed increases both thinking and braking distance. Alcohol consumption\nincreases reaction time (thus thinking distance) but does not directly affect braking distance. Wet\nroads reduce friction (increasing braking distance) but do not affect thinking distance.',

  {
    question:
      'If a car’s speed doubles from 20 m/s to 40 m/s, by what factor does its braking distance\nincrease, assuming constant braking deceleration?',
    options: ['A) Doubles', 'B) Triples', 'C)\nQuadruples', 'D) Remains the same'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      'Using v^2 = u^2 + 2as with v = 0:\nbraking distance s = u^2/(2a). If speed doubles (u -> 2u), s -> (2u)^2/(2a) = 4u^2/(2a) = 4s.\nBraking distance increases by a factor of 4 (quadruples).',
