## Interface Basics

An interface in Go defines a set of method signatures. A type satisfies an interface by implementing
All of its methods. There is no explicit `implements` declaration -- satisfaction is implicit and
Structural.

```go
type Speaker interface {
    Speak() string
}

type Dog struct {
    Name string
}

func (d Dog) Speak() string {
    return "Woof"
}

func main() {
    var s Speaker = Dog{Name: "Rex"}
    fmt.Println(s.Speak()) // Woof
}
```

Any type that has a `Speak() string` method satisfies `Speaker`Regardless of its position in the
Type hierarchy.

## Interface Composition

Interfaces can be composed from other interfaces:

```go
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Writer interface {
    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Closer interface {
    Close() error
}

type ReadWriteCloser interface {
    Reader
    Writer
    Closer
}
```

`ReadWriteCloser` requires all methods from `Reader``Writer`And `Closer`.

## The Empty Interface

`interface{}` (or `any` since Go 1.18) is the empty interface, satisfied by every type:

```go
var x any
x = 42
x = "hello"
x = []int{1, 2, 3}
```

The empty interface is a escape hatch when you need to store values of different types. It should be
Used sparingly -- it bypasses the type system and requires runtime type assertions to use safely.

### When to Use `any`

Acceptable uses:

- Format functions (`fmt.Printf`): the caller does not know what types they are passing
- Generic containers before Go 1.18 generics
- Interoperability with untyped external data (JSON, protocol buffers)
- Heterogeneous collections that are genuinely heterogeneous (e.g., configuration values)

Avoid when:

- You know the concrete type at compile time
- A parameter accepts a small, known set of types (use a union type or an interface)
- You are passing `any` through multiple function layers without ever checking the type

## Type Assertions

A type assertion extracts the concrete value from an interface:

```go
var i any = "hello"

s := i.(string)        // panic if i does not hold a string
fmt.Println(s)         // "hello"

s, ok := i.(string)    // safe: ok is false if assertion fails
if ok {
    fmt.Println(s)
}
```

Always use the comma-ok idiom unless you are certain of the type:

```go
func process(v any) {
    if s, ok := v.(string); ok {
        fmt.Println("string:", s)
    } else if n, ok := v.(int); ok {
        fmt.Println("int:", n)
    }
}
```

## Type Switches

A type switch performs multiple type assertions in sequence:

```go
func inspect(v any) {
    switch val := v.(type) {
    case int:
        fmt.Printf("int: %d\n", val)
    case string:
        fmt.Printf("string: %s (len %d)\n", val, len(val))
    case bool:
        fmt.Printf("bool: %t\n", val)
    case nil:
        fmt.Println("nil")
    default:
        fmt.Printf("unknown: %T\n", val)
    }
}
```

In a type switch, `val` has the type of the matched case. In the `default` case, `val` has the same
Type as `v` (the interface type).

### Type Switch with Interface Cases

Cases can also be interfaces:

```go
switch v.(type) {
case io.Reader:
    fmt.Println("implements io.Reader")
case io.Writer:
    fmt.Println("implements io.Writer")
case io.ReadWriter:
    fmt.Println("implements io.ReadWriter")
}
```

A value matches the first case whose interface it satisfies.

## Pointer vs Value Receivers and Interfaces

This is a critical subtlety. The method set of `T` includes only value receiver methods. The method
Set of `*T` includes all methods. This affects interface satisfaction:

```go
type Foo interface {
    Bar()
}

type MyType struct{}

func (m *MyType) Bar() {} // pointer receiver

func main() {
    var f Foo = MyType{}   // compile error: MyType does not implement Foo
    var f Foo = &MyType{}  // OK: *MyType implements Foo
}
```

The rule: if any method of an interface has a pointer receiver, only a pointer to the type (not the
Value itself) satisfies the interface. This is because calling a pointer receiver on a copy of the
Value would be meaningless -- the method modifies the receiver, but the modification is lost when
The copy is discarded.

## Nil Interface Values

An interface value is a two-word tuple: (type, value). A nil interface has both type and value set
To nil:

```go
var s Speaker
fmt.Println(s == nil) // true
```

A non-nil interface can hold a nil value:

```go
var p *Dog
var s Speaker = p // type is *Dog, value is nil
fmt.Println(s == nil) // false!
```

This is a common source of bugs. The interface is not nil because its type is `*Dog`Even though The
value is nil. Calling a method on it works (the receiver is nil inside the method), but Comparing
the interface to `nil` does not detect it.

```go
func process(s Speaker) {
    if s == nil {
        fmt.Println("nil interface")
        return
    }
    fmt.Println(s.Speak()) // may panic if the concrete value is nil
}
```

## Interface Zero Value

The zero value of an interface is `nil`. Calling any method on a nil interface causes a panic:

```go
var s Speaker
s.Speak() // panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```

Always check for nil before calling methods on an interface, or ensure the interface is always
Initialized.

## Common Interfaces

Go"s standard library defines several pervasive interfaces:

| Interface        | Methods                                        | Used By                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `io.Reader`      | `Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)`            | Files, network connections     |
| `io.Writer`      | `Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)`           | Files, buffers, HTTP responses |
| `io.Closer`      | `Close() error`                                | Files, connections             |
| `fmt.Stringer`   | `String() string`                              | Custom string representation   |
| `error`          | `Error() string`                               | Error values                   |
| `sort.Interface` | `Len() int``Less(i,j int) bool``Swap(i,j int)` | Sorting                        |

Implementing `fmt.Stringer`:

```go
type IPAddr [4]byte

func (ip IPAddr) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%d.%d.%d.%d", ip[0], ip[1], ip[2], ip[3])
}

fmt.Println(IPAddr{127, 0, 0, 1}) // 127.0.0.1
```

## Intuition

**Interfaces are behavioral contracts, not inheritance hierarchies:** In Go, you don't declare that a type implements an interface — it just does. If a duck walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it satisfies the Duck interface. This structural typing means interfaces emerge logically from concrete types, not from forced inheritance trees.

**Why it matters:** Interfaces enable dependency injection, testability, and polymorphism without complex class hierarchies. The standard library is built on small interfaces (io.Reader, io.Writer) that thousands of types satisfy. Understanding interface satisfaction, pointer receivers, and nil interfaces is essential for writing idiomatic Go.

**The key insight:** An interface value is a (type, value) tuple — even if the value is nil, the interface itself is not nil if it has a type. This is the most common source of nil interface bugs.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Nil interface with non-nil concrete type.** An interface holding a `*T` where `T` is nil is not
   equal to `nil`. Use reflection (`reflect.ValueOf(i).IsNil()`) or check the concrete value if this
   situation is possible.

2. **Pointer receiver methods and interface satisfaction.** If an interface method has a pointer
   receiver, only `*T` satisfies the interface, not `T`. This is the single most common interface
   compilation error.

3. **Overusing `any`.** Passing `any` through function signatures defeats the purpose of the type
   system. Prefer specific interfaces. Use generics (Go 1.18+) when you need to abstract over types
   while maintaining type safety.

4. **Duck typing confusion.** Go interfaces are structural, not nominal. Two independently defined
   types with the same method set satisfy the same interface. This is a feature, but it means you
   can accidentally satisfy an interface you did not intend to.

5. **Empty interface in slices.** `[]any` is a common pattern but loses type safety. Since Go 1.18,
   prefer generics: `[]T` where `T` is a type parameter.
