## Database Design and Development

## Higher Database Design

### Flat Files vs. Relational Databases

**Flat files:**

- Single table, simple structure
- Suitable for small amounts of data
- Problems: data redundancy, data inconsistency, data dependency, difficulty of sharing, security
  issues

**Relational databases:**

- Multiple related tables
- Minimise redundancy through normalisation
- Support concurrent access, security, integrity
- Query using SQL (Structured Query Language)

| Feature           | Flat File           | Relational Database         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Tables            | Single              | Multiple, related           |
| Redundancy        | High                | Minimised by normalisation  |
| Data integrity    | Not enforced        | Enforced by constraints     |
| Concurrent access | Not supported       | Supported with locking      |
| Querying          | Manual (sequential) | SQL (declarative, powerful) |
| Scalability       | Poor                | Good                        |
| Security          | Limited             | User accounts, permissions  |

### Relational Database Concepts

**Entity:** A thing of interest (e.g., Student, Course).

**Attribute:** A property of an entity (e.g., student name, course code).

**Relation (Table):** A set of tuples (rows) with the same attributes (columns).

**Tuple (Record):** A single row in a table.

**Domain:** The set of allowable values for an attribute.

**Primary Key:** A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Must be
Unique and not null.

**Foreign Key:** A column in one table that references the primary key of another table. Establishes
Relationships.

**Composite key:** A primary key made up of two or more columns.

**Candidate key:** Any column or set of columns that could serve as a primary key.

**Worked Example.** In a table of Students, which of the following could be a candidate key:
StudentID, Name, Email?

StudentID is a candidate key (unique, not null). Name is not (two students can have the same name).
Email could be a candidate key if the system requires unique emails.

### Entity-Relationship Modelling

**Step 1: Identify entities and attributes**

For a school system:

- Student (StudentID, Name, DateOfBirth, Address)
- Course (CourseCode, CourseName, Credits)
- Enrolment (StudentID, CourseCode, Grade)

**Step 2: Identify relationships**

- A Student can enrol in many Courses
- A Course can have many Students
- This is a many-to-many (M:N) relationship, which requires a junction table (Enrolment)

**Step 3: Draw the ER diagram**

```
Student (1) ----< Enrolment >---- (1) Course
```

### Normalisation

Normalisation is the process of organising data to minimise redundancy and dependency.

**Unnormalised Form (UNF):** Raw data with repeating groups.

**First Normal Form (1NF):** No repeating groups. Every cell contains a single value. Each row is
Unique (has a primary key).

**Second Normal Form (2NF):** In 1NF and no partial dependencies (every non-key attribute depends on
The entire primary key, not just part of it). Only applies to tables with composite keys.

**Third Normal Form (3NF):** In 2NF and no transitive dependencies (no non-key attribute depends on
Another non-key attribute).

**Example of normalisation:**

**UNF:**

| OrderID | CustomerName | CustomerCity | ProductCode | ProductName | Quantity |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 001     | J. Smith     | Edinburgh    | P01         | Widget      | 5        |
| 001     | J. Smith     | Edinburgh    | P02         | Gadget      | 3        |
| 002     | A. Jones     | Glasgow      | P01         | Widget      | 2        |

**1NF (remove repeating groups):** Already in 1NF (each cell has a single value).

**2NF (remove partial dependencies):**

The composite key is (OrderID, ProductCode). CustomerName and CustomerCity depend only on OrderID
(partial dependency). ProductName depends only on ProductCode (partial dependency).

Split into:

- Order (OrderID, CustomerName, CustomerCity)
- Product (ProductCode, ProductName)
- OrderLine (OrderID, ProductCode, Quantity)

**3NF (remove transitive dependencies):**

In Order, CustomerCity depends on CustomerName (transitive dependency). Split into:

- Customer (CustomerID, CustomerName, CustomerCity)
- Order (OrderID, CustomerID)
- Product (ProductCode, ProductName)
- OrderLine (OrderID, ProductCode, Quantity)

**Why normalisation matters.** Without normalisation:

- **Update anomaly:** If J. Smith moves city, we must update every row with their name.
- **Insertion anomaly:** We cannot add a new customer until they place an order.
- **Deletion anomaly:** If order 002 is deleted, we lose the information that Widget is a product.

### Referential Integrity

Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent.

- A foreign key value must either be null or match a value in the referenced primary key
- Cannot delete a record that is referenced by a foreign key in another table (without cascading)

**Worked Example.** If we try to delete StudentID = 1 from the Student table, but there are
Enrolment records with StudentID = 1, the DBMS should reject the deletion (or cascade it to also
Delete the enrolments).

### Data Types in SQL

| SQL Data Type | Description            | Example          |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| INT / INTEGER | Whole number           | 42               |
| REAL / FLOAT  | Decimal number         | 3.14             |
| DECIMAL(p, s) | Fixed-point decimal    | DECIMAL(10, 2)   |
| CHAR(n)       | Fixed-length string    | CHAR(10)         |
| VARCHAR(n)    | Variable-length string | VARCHAR(255)     |
| DATE          | Date (YYYY-MM-DD)      | "2026-04-14'     |
| BOOLEAN       | True/False             | TRUE             |
| TEXT          | Long text              | 'Description...' |

## SQL (Structured Query Language)

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

**Creating tables:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    House VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseCode VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Teacher VARCHAR(50),
    Credits INT
);

CREATE TABLE Enrolment (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseCode VARCHAR(10),
    Grade CHAR(2),
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseCode),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseCode) REFERENCES Course(CourseCode)
);
```

**Modifying tables:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE Student ADD COLUMN Email VARCHAR(100);

ALTER TABLE Student DROP COLUMN House;
```

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

**INSERT:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, House)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'MacDonald', '2005-03-15', 'Gryffindor');

INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth)
VALUES (2, 'Bob', 'Campbell', '2004-11-22');
```

**UPDATE:**

```sql
UPDATE Student
SET House = 'Slytherin'
WHERE StudentID = 2;
```

**DELETE:**

```sql
DELETE FROM Enrolment
WHERE Grade IS NULL;
```

### Queries (SELECT)

**Basic SELECT:**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, House
FROM Student
WHERE House = 'Gryffindor';
```

**Wildcards and pattern matching:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE LastName LIKE 'Mc%';
```

**ORDER BY:**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth
FROM Student
ORDER BY DateOfBirth DESC;
```

**Aggregate functions:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents
FROM Student;

SELECT House, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Student
GROUP BY House
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

**JOIN:**

```sql
SELECT Student.FirstName, Student.LastName, Course.CourseName, Enrolment.Grade
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Enrolment ON Student.StudentID = Enrolment.StudentID
INNER JOIN Course ON Enrolment.CourseCode = Course.CourseCode
WHERE Enrolment.Grade IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY Student.LastName;
```

**LEFT JOIN:** Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.

```sql
SELECT Student.FirstName, Student.LastName, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
LEFT JOIN Enrolment ON Student.StudentID = Enrolment.StudentID
LEFT JOIN Course ON Enrolment.CourseCode = Course.CourseCode
ORDER BY Student.LastName;
```

**Subqueries:**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Student
WHERE StudentID IN (
    SELECT StudentID FROM Enrolment
    WHERE CourseCode = 'MATH101'
);
```

**Worked Example.** Find all students who are enrolled in more than 3 courses.

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Student
WHERE StudentID IN (
    SELECT StudentID FROM Enrolment
    GROUP BY StudentID
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
);
```

### Data Validation

**NOT NULL:** Column cannot be empty.

**UNIQUE:** All values in the column must be different.

**CHECK:** Values must satisfy a condition.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Product (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Price > 0),
    StockQuantity INT CHECK (StockQuantity >= 0)
);
```

## Advanced Higher Database Concepts

### Transaction Management (ACID)

**Atomicity:** A transaction is all-or-nothing. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled
Back.

**Consistency:** The database moves from one valid state to another.

**Isolation:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.

**Durability:** Once committed, changes are permanent even if the system crashes.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;

COMMIT;
```

If any statement fails: `ROLLBACK;`

**Worked Example.** Explain why ACID properties are important for a bank transfer.

Atomicity ensures either both the debit and credit happen, or neither does. Consistency ensures
Balances remain valid (no negative balances if not allowed). Isolation prevents two simultaneous
Transfers from interfering. Durability ensures the transfer is permanent once committed.

### Indexing

An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_student_name ON Student(LastName, FirstName);
```

**Advantages:** Faster SELECT queries.

**Disadvantages:** Slower INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE; uses additional storage.

**When to create an index:** On columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER
BY clauses. Do not index columns that are rarely queried or frequently updated.

### Views

A view is a virtual table based on a SELECT query.

```sql
CREATE VIEW TopStudents AS
SELECT Student.FirstName, Student.LastName, AVG(Enrolment.Grade) AS AverageGrade
FROM Student
JOIN Enrolment ON Student.StudentID = Enrolment.StudentID
GROUP BY Student.StudentID, Student.FirstName, Student.LastName
HAVING AVG(Enrolment.Grade) >= 70;
```

**Benefits of views:** Simplify complex queries, restrict data access (security), present data in a
Different format.

## Advanced SQL Techniques

### Window Functions (Higher)

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Grade,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Grade DESC) AS Rank
FROM Students;
```

**Common window functions:**

| Function   | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ROW_NUMBER | Sequential number (no ties)         |
| RANK       | Rank with gaps for ties             |
| DENSE_RANK | Rank without gaps for ties          |
| LAG / LEAD | Access value from previous/next row |
| SUM / AVG  | Running total / running average     |

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

A CTE is a named temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or
DELETE.

```sql
WITH HighScorers AS (
    SELECT StudentID, AVG(Mark) AS AverageMark
    FROM Results
    GROUP BY StudentID
    HAVING AVG(Mark) >= 75
)
SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, hs.AverageMark
FROM Students s
JOIN HighScorers hs ON s.StudentID = hs.StudentID
ORDER BY hs.AverageMark DESC;
```

### Stored Procedures

A stored procedure is a reusable set of SQL statements stored in the database.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE EnrolStudent(
    IN pStudentID INT,
    IN pCourseCode VARCHAR(10)
)
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Enrolment (StudentID, CourseCode)
    VALUES (pStudentID, pCourseCode);
END;
```

**Benefits:** Improved performance (pre-compiled), reduced network traffic, code reuse, security
(controls data access).

### SQL Injection Prevention in Detail

**Vulnerable code:**

```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
```

**Attack:** Enter `admin' OR '1'='1` as username. The query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1' AND password = ''
```

This returns all users, bypassing authentication.

**Prevention methods:**

1. **Parameterised queries** (always use these).
2. **Input validation** (whitelist allowed characters).
3. **Stored procedures** (with parameters).
4. **Least privilege** (application database account has minimal permissions).

### Database Normalisation Practice

**Worked Example.** Normalise the following table to 3NF.

| PlayerID | Name     | TeamName | TeamCity | Sport    |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1        | J. Smith | Rangers  | Glasgow  | Football |
| 2        | A. Jones | Celtic   | Glasgow  | Football |
| 3        | M. Brown | Rangers  | Glasgow  | Football |

**1NF:** Already in 1NF (single values per cell).

**2NF:** No composite key, so already in 2NF.

**3NF:** TeamCity depends on TeamName, not PlayerID (transitive dependency).

**Result:**

- Player (PlayerID, Name, TeamName)
- Team (TeamName, TeamCity, Sport)

### Database Indexing in Detail

An index is a B-tree (or hash) data structure that speeds up data retrieval at the cost of slower
Writes and additional storage.

**When to create an index:**

- Columns frequently used in WHERE clauses.
- Columns used in JOIN conditions.
- Columns used in ORDER BY clauses.

**When NOT to create an index:**

- Small tables (full table scan is fast enough).
- Columns that are frequently updated (index must be rebuilt).
- Columns with low selectivity (e.g., boolean with mostly the same value).

## Practice Questions

1. Write SQL using a CTE to find the top 5 students by average grade across all their courses.

2. Explain what a stored procedure is and give two advantages of using them.

3. A table has the following functional dependencies: A -> B, B -> C, C -> D. Is this table in 3NF?
    If not, normalise it.

4. Write SQL to create a stored procedure that transfers a student from one course to another.

5. Explain how a B-tree index works. Why is it more efficient than a sequential scan for large
    tables?

6. Write SQL that uses a window function to rank students by grade within each subject.

7. Explain three methods of preventing SQL injection. For each, explain how it works.

8. A company database has tables for Departments, Employees, and Projects. Design the schema with
    appropriate relationships and write the CREATE TABLE statements.

9. Explain the difference between ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK with an example showing how they
    differ when there are ties.

10. Write SQL to find all students who scored above the average in every course they are enrolled
    in.

11. Explain the concept of a database deadlock. How can deadlocks be prevented?

12. Compare the performance of an inner join vs a subquery for finding matching records. When would
    each be more appropriate?

## Database Security

### Access Control

SQL provides GRANT and REVOKE statements for managing permissions.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Students TO 'librarian'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Students TO 'admin'@'localhost';
REVOKE DELETE ON Students FROM 'librarian'@'localhost';
```

**Principle of least privilege:** Users should only have the minimum permissions needed to do Their
job. A librarian who only needs to search for books should not have DELETE permissions.

### Backup Strategies

| Strategy            | Description                                         | Recovery Point Objective |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Full backup         | Complete copy of the entire database                | Last backup              |
| Differential backup | All changes since the last full backup              | Last full backup         |
| Incremental backup  | All changes since the last backup (any type)        | Last backup              |
| Transaction log     | Records all transactions for point-in-time recovery | Any point in time        |

**Worked Example.** A database is backed up fully on Sunday. Differential backups run Monday to
Saturday. The database crashes on Thursday. What backups are needed to restore?

Restore the full backup from Sunday, then the differential backup from Wednesday (the most recent
Differential before the crash).

### Database Transactions in Practice

**Isolation levels:**

| Level            | Dirty Read | Non-repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Read Uncommitted | Yes        | Yes                 | Yes          |
| Read Committed   | No         | Yes                 | Yes          |
| Repeatable Read  | No         | No                  | Yes          |
| Serializable     | No         | No                  | No           |

**Deadlocks:** Occur when two transactions each hold a lock that the other needs.

Example: Transaction A locks row 1 and needs row 2. Transaction B locks row 2 and needs row 1.
Neither can proceed.

**Prevention:** Always acquire locks in the same order, use timeouts, or use deadlock detection.

## Data Warehousing (Higher)

A **data warehouse** is a large, centralised database used for reporting and analysis. It integrates
Data from multiple sources.

**Data warehouse vs operational database:**

| Feature         | Operational Database    | Data Warehouse             |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Purpose         | Day-to-day transactions | Reporting and analysis     |
| Data volume     | Moderate                | Very large                 |
| Data structure  | Normalised (3NF)        | Denormalised (star schema) |
| Query pattern   | Many small reads/writes | Few large, complex reads   |
| Historical data | Current state           | Years of historical data   |

**Star schema:** A central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.

Example: Sales fact table surrounded by Date, Product, Store, and Customer dimension tables.

## Additional Practice Questions

1. Explain the difference between a full backup, a differential backup, and an incremental backup.
    When would you use each?

2. Write SQL GRANT and REVOKE statements for the following scenario: a sales clerk can only INSERT
    and SELECT from the Orders table, while the manager has full privileges.

3. Explain what a deadlock is and describe two strategies for preventing deadlocks.

4. Explain the difference between the four transaction isolation levels. Which is the safest and
    which is the most performant?

5. Describe the star schema used in data warehousing. What is a fact table and what is a dimension
    table?

6. Write SQL to create a trigger that logs all INSERT operations on the Students table to an
    AuditLog table.

7. Explain the concept of database replication. Why is it used and what are the challenges?

8. A company needs to store 5 years of transaction data for analysis. Explain why a data warehouse
    is more suitable than an operational database for this purpose.

## Worked Examples

See the examples integrated throughout the sections above.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting primary keys:** Every table must have a primary key to uniquely identify each
   record.

2. **Data redundancy:** Not normalising leads to update anomalies, insertion anomalies, and deletion
   anomalies.

3. **NULL in aggregates:** COUNT(\*) counts all rows including NULL; COUNT(column) counts non-NULL
   values.

4. **INNER JOIN vs. LEFT JOIN:** INNER JOIN returns only matching rows; LEFT JOIN returns all rows
   from the left table.

5. **String quotes:** SQL uses single quotes for string literals, not double quotes.

6. **Forgetting WHERE in UPDATE/DELETE.** Without WHERE, all rows are affected.

7. **Confusing HAVING and WHERE.** WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after
   GROUP BY.

8. **Not using parameterised queries** -- leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Intuition

A database is like a library with a very strict librarian -- every book has a unique call number (primary key), is filed in a specific section (tables), and the librarian knows exactly where everything is (indexing). Normalisation is the process of organising the library so that each fact is stored in exactly one place -- you do not want the same address written on ten different forms. SQL is the language you use to ask the librarian for information, and joins are how you combine information from different sections to answer complex questions. The trade-off is between normalised design (clean, consistent) and denormalised design (fast, redundant).
