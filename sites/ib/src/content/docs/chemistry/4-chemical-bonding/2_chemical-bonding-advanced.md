## 1. VSEPR Theory

### Principle

The **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion** (VSEPR) theory predicts molecular geometry based on
The repulsion between electron pairs (both bonding and lone pairs) around a central atom.

**Postulates:**

1. Electron pairs arrange themselves to minimise repulsion.
2. Repulsion order: lone pair--lone pair $\gt$ lone pair--bonding pair $\gt$ bonding pair--bonding
   pair.
3. Lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs because they are held by one nucleus and spread
   closer to the central atom.
4. Multiple bonds are treated as a single region of electron density (but repel more strongly than
   single bonds).

### Electron Pair Geometries

| Electron pairs | Geometry             | Bond angle              |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| $2$            | Linear               | $180\degree$            |
| $3$            | Trigonal planar      | $120\degree$            |
| $4$            | Tetrahedral          | $109.5\degree$          |
| $5$            | Trigonal bipyramidal | $120\degree, 90\degree$ |
| $6$            | Octahedral           | $90\degree$             |

| $4$           | $0$        | Tetrahedral          | $109.5\degree$                  | $\mathrm{CH}_4$, $\mathrm{NH}_4^+$                 |

### Bond Angle Distortions

Lone pair repulsion compresses bond angles. The more lone pairs, the greater the compression:

| Molecule                 | Expected       | Actual         | Reason                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| $\mathrm{NH}_3$          | $109.5\degree$ | $107\degree$   | One lone pair compresses angles     |
| $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ | $109.5\degree$ | $104.5\degree$ | Two lone pairs compress angles more |

Electronegativity effects also distort angles: more electronegative terminal atoms pull bonding
Pairs away from the central atom, reducing repulsion and **decreasing** bond angles.

### Common Pitfalls

- Confusing steric number (total regions of electron density) with the number of atoms bonded.
- Placing lone pairs in equatorial positions of trigonal bipyramidal arrangements (equatorial
  positions minimise $90\degree$ repulsions).
- Forgetting that double and triple bonds count as one region of electron density.

## 2. Hybridization

### Definition

**Hybridization** is a mathematical model that combines atomic orbitals on the central atom to form
Equivalent hybrid orbitals that explain observed geometries.

### Types of Hybridization

| Hybridization | Geometry             | Orbitals combined | Angle                   |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| $sp$          | Linear               | $1s + 1p$         | $180\degree$            |
| $sp^2$        | Trigonal planar      | $1s + 2p$         | $120\degree$            |
| $sp^3$        | Tetrahedral          | $1s + 3p$         | $109.5\degree$          |
| $sp^3d$       | Trigonal bipyramidal | $1s + 3p + 1d$    | $120\degree, 90\degree$ |
| $sp^3d^2$     | Octahedral           | $1s + 3p + 2d$    | $90\degree$             |

### Determining Hybridization

Count the regions of electron density (steric number) around the central atom:

$$
\mathrm{Steric number} = \mathrm{bonded atoms} + \mathrm{lone pairs}
$$

| Steric number | Hybridization |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $2$           | $sp$          |
| $3$           | $sp^2$        |
| $4$           | $sp^3$        |
| $5$           | $sp^3d$       |
| $6$           | $sp^3d^2$     |

### Examples

| Molecule                 | Central atom | Steric number | Hybridization | Shape                |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| $\mathrm{CH}_4$          | C            | $4$           | $sp^3$        | Tetrahedral          |
| $\mathrm{NH}_3$          | N            | $4$           | $sp^3$        | Trigonal pyramidal   |
| $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ | O            | $4$           | $sp^3$        | Bent                 |
| $\mathrm{BF}_3$          | B            | $3$           | $sp^2$        | Trigonal planar      |
| $\mathrm{CO}_2$          | C            | $2$           | $sp$          | Linear               |
| $\mathrm{SF}_6$          | S            | $6$           | $sp^3d^2$     | Octahedral           |
| $\mathrm{PCl}_5$         | P            | $5$           | $sp^3d$       | Trigonal bipyramidal |

### Sigma and Pi Bonds

- **Sigma ($\sigma$) bond**: formed by head-on overlap of orbitals along the internuclear axis.
  Always the first bond between two atoms. Can be formed by $s$-$s$, $s$-$p$, $p$-$p$Or hybrid-hybrid
  overlap.
- **Pi ($\pi$) bond**: formed by sideways overlap of parallel $p$-orbitals. Always the second (or
  third) bond in a multiple bond.

A double bond consists of one $\sigma$ and one $\pi$ bond. A triple bond consists of one $\sigma$
And two $\pi$ bonds.

$$
\mathrm{C=C}: 1\sigma + 1\pi, \qquad \mathrm{C\equiv C}: 1\sigma + 2\pi
$$

### Common Pitfalls

- Hybridization describes the central atom's orbitals, not the entire molecule.
- Lone pairs are included in the steric number when determining hybridization.
- Pi bonds do not participate in hybridization — they involve unhybridized $p$-orbitals.

## 3. Molecular Orbital Theory

### Principle

Molecular orbital (MO) theory treats the molecule as a whole. Atomic orbitals combine to form
Molecular orbitals that are delocalised over the entire molecule.

### Rules for Forming MOs

1. Atomic orbitals must have similar energy.
2. Atomic orbitals must overlap effectively.
3. The number of MOs equals the number of atomic orbitals combined.
4. MOs that are lower in energy than the parent AOs are **bonding**; those higher are
   **antibonding**.
5. Each MO can hold two electrons with opposite spins.

### MO Diagrams for Diatomic Molecules

For homonuclear diatomics ($\mathrm{O}_2$, $\mathrm{F}_2$And beyond):

$$
\sigma_{1s} \lt \sigma_{1s}^* \lt \sigma_{2s} \lt \sigma_{2s}^* \lt \sigma_{2p_z} \lt \pi_{2p_x} = \pi_{2p_y} \lt \pi_{2p_x}^* = \pi_{2p_y}^* \lt \sigma_{2p_z}^*
$$

For $\mathrm{B}_2$$\mathrm{C}_2$$\mathrm{N}_2$ (and $\mathrm{Li}_2$$\mathrm{Be}_2$), the
$\sigma_{2p_z}$ and $\pi_{2p}$ levels are reversed:

$$
\cdots \lt \pi_{2p_x} = \pi_{2p_y} \lt \sigma_{2p_z} \lt \pi_{2p_x}^* = \pi_{2p_y}^* \lt \sigma_{2p_z}^*
$$

### Bond Order

$$
\mathrm{Bond order} = \frac{N_{\mathrm{bonding}} - N_{\mathrm{antibonding}}}{2}
$$

| Molecule        | Bond order | Bond type      | Magnetic         |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| $\mathrm{H}_2$  | $1$        | Single         | Diamagnetic      |
| $\mathrm{He}_2$ | $0$        | Does not exist | —                |
| $\mathrm{Li}_2$ | $1$        | Single         | Diamagnetic      |
| $\mathrm{B}_2$  | $1$        | Single         | **Paramagnetic** |
| $\mathrm{C}_2$  | $2$        | Double         | Diamagnetic      |
| $\mathrm{N}_2$  | $3$        | Triple         | Diamagnetic      |
| $\mathrm{O}_2$  | $2$        | Double         | **Paramagnetic** |
| $\mathrm{F}_2$  | $1$        | Single         | Diamagnetic      |
| $\mathrm{Ne}_2$ | $0$        | Does not exist | —                |

### Key Successes of MO Theory

- Explains why $\mathrm{O}_2$ is **paramagnetic** (two unpaired electrons in $\pi^*$ orbitals) —
  VSEPR and valence bond theory cannot explain this.
- Explains why $\mathrm{He}_2$ and $\mathrm{Ne}_2$ do not exist (bond order = 0).
- Predicts correct bond orders and bond lengths.

### Common Pitfalls

- The ordering of $\sigma_{2p}$ and $\pi_{2p}$ reverses between $\mathrm{N}_2$ and $\mathrm{O}_2$.
- Bond order of zero means the molecule is unstable.
- Antibonding electrons weaken the bond more than bonding electrons strengthen it.

## 4. Metallic Bonding

### The Sea of Electrons Model

In a metal, the valence electrons are delocalised over the entire lattice of positive metal ions.
These delocalised electrons form an "electron sea" that holds the metal cations together through
Electrostatic attraction.

### Properties Explained by Metallic Bonding

| Property                | Explanation                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Electrical conductivity | Delocalised electrons can move freely under an applied potential          |
| Thermal conductivity    | Delocalised electrons transfer kinetic energy                             |
| Malleability            | Cations can slide past each other without breaking the metallic bond      |
| Ductility               | Same as malleability — layers of cations can shift                        |
| High melting points     | Strong electrostatic attraction between cations and electrons             |
| Luster                  | Delocalised electrons absorb and re-emit light at all visible wavelengths |

### Factors Affecting Metallic Bond Strength

| Factor                     | Effect                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| More delocalised electrons | Stronger bonding                               |
| Smaller ionic radius       | Stronger bonding (cations closer to electrons) |
| Higher ionic charge        | Stronger bonding                               |

| Comparison | Stronger bonding | Reason                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Na vs Al   | Al               | Al contributes 3 electrons, Na contributes 1          |
| Mg vs Ca   | Mg               | $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is smaller than $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ |

## 5. Band Theory

### Formation of Energy Bands

When a large number of atoms are brought together (as in a metal), the discrete atomic energy levels
Broaden into **energy bands** due to orbital overlap.

- **Valence band**: the highest occupied band at $0\mathrm{ K}$.
- **Conduction band**: the lowest unoccupied band.
- **Band gap** ($E_g$): the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of
  the conduction band.

### Classification of Solids

| Type          | Band gap    | Conductivity                    | Examples                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metal         | $E_g = 0$   | High; electrons promoted        | $\mathrm{Cu}$$\mathrm{Fe}$$\mathrm{Na}$                              |
| Semiconductor | Small $E_g$ | Moderate; temperature-dependent | $\mathrm{Si}$ ($1.1\mathrm{ eV}$), $\mathrm{Ge}$ ($0.7\mathrm{ eV}$) |
| Insulator     | Large $E_g$ | Very low                        | Diamond ($5.5\mathrm{ eV}$), $\mathrm{SiO}_2$                        |

### Semiconductor Behaviour

In an intrinsic semiconductor at $0\mathrm{ K}$The valence band is full and the conduction band is
Empty. As temperature increases:

1. Some electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap.
2. These electrons enter the conduction band and carry charge.
3. The holes left in the valence band also contribute to conduction.

$$
N_i \propto \exp\!\left(-\frac{E_g}{2k_BT}\right)
$$

### Doping

- **n-type semiconductor**: doped with a Group 15 element (e.g., P in Si). Extra electrons are
  donated to the conduction band.
- **p-type semiconductor**: doped with a Group 13 element (e.g., B in Si). Holes are created in the
  valence band.

### Common Pitfalls

- The band gap is a property of the bulk material, not individual atoms.
- Metals have overlapping valence and conduction bands, not a zero band gap with separate bands.
- In p-type semiconductors, it is holes (positive charge carriers) that conduct, not the dopant
  atoms themselves.

## Practice Problems

<details>
<summary>Problem 1</summary>

Predict the shape and bond angles of $\mathrm{ClF}_3$ and explain why the lone pairs occupy
Equatorial positions.

**Solution:**

Chlorine has $7$ valence electrons. In $\mathrm{ClF}_3$: $3$ bonding pairs + $2$ lone pairs = $5$
Regions of electron density (trigonal bipyramidal electron pair geometry).

The lone pairs occupy **equatorial** positions because this minimises the number of $90\degree$ lone
Pair--bonding pair repulsions. If the lone pairs were axial, they would experience three $90\degree$
Repulsions each. In equatorial positions, they experience only two $90\degree$ repulsions each.

Molecular shape: **T-shaped**. Bond angles: approximately $87.5\degree$ and $175\degree$ (slightly
Compressed from $90\degree$ and $180\degree$ due to lone pair repulsion).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 2</summary>

Construct the MO diagram for $\mathrm{O}_2$ and use it to explain the paramagnetism and bond order.

**Solution:**

Electron configuration of $\mathrm{O}_2$ ($12$ valence electrons):

$$
\sigma_{2s}^2\, (\sigma_{2s}^*)^2\, \sigma_{2p_z}^2\, \pi_{2p_x}^2\, \pi_{2p_y}^2\, (\pi_{2p_x}^*)^1\, (\pi_{2p_y}^*)^1
$$

Bond order $= \frac{10 - 6}{2} = 2$

The two unpaired electrons in the degenerate $\pi_{2p}^*$ orbitals make $\mathrm{O}_2$ paramagnetic.
This is confirmed experimentally: liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 3</summary>

Explain why the melting point of aluminium ($660\degree\mathrm{C}$) is much higher than that of
Sodium ($98\degree\mathrm{C}$).

**Solution:**

Aluminium has the electron configuration $[\mathrm{Ne}]\, 3s^2\, 3p^1$ and contributes **three**
Delocalised electrons to the metallic bond. Sodium has $[\mathrm{Ne}]\, 3s^1$ and contributes only
**one**. More delocalised electrons produce stronger electrostatic attraction between the cations
And the electron sea. Additionally, $\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$ is smaller than $\mathrm{Na}^+$So the Charge
density is higher and the ions are closer together. Both factors increase the strength of the
Metallic bond and therefore the melting point.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem 4</summary>

Silicon has a band gap of $1.1\mathrm{ eV}$. Calculate the minimum wavelength of light required to
Excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band.

**Solution:**

$$
E = \frac`\{hc}`{\lambda} \implies \lambda = \frac`\{hc}`{E}
$$

$$
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.1 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1.988 \times 10^{-25}}{1.762 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.13 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{ m} = 1130\mathrm{ nm}
$$

This is in the infrared region.

## Worked Examples

**Worked Example: VSEPR prediction for an oxoanion**

Predict the molecular geometry, bond angles, hybridization, and polarity of the $\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$
ion.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Step 1: Draw the Lewis structure.**

Sulfur has 6 valence electrons. Each oxygen contributes 6. The $-2$ charge adds 2 electrons. Total:
$6 + 4(6) + 2 = 32$ valence electrons.

Sulfur forms double bonds with all four oxygens (expanding the octet since S is in Period 3): No
lone pairs on sulfur. Each oxygen has 2 lone pairs.

$$\mathrm{O}_2\mathrm{S}(=\mathrm{O})_2^{2-}$$

**Step 2: Determine the steric number.**

Bonding pairs on S: 4. Lone pairs on S: 0. Steric number = 4.

**Step 3: Predict geometry and hybridization.**

Electron pair geometry: tetrahedral. Molecular shape: tetrahedral. Hybridization: $sp^3$.

**Step 4: Bond angles.**

All $\mathrm{O\!-\!S\!-\!O}$ bond angles are approximately $109.5\degree$ (ideal tetrahedral). The
Double bonds repel slightly more than single bonds, so angles may deviate by a few degrees, but the
Overall geometry remains tetrahedral.

**Step 5: Polarity.**

The $\mathrm{S\!-\!O}$ bond dipoles are symmetrically arranged and cancel. $\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$ is
**nonpolar** despite having polar bonds.

</details>

**Worked Example: MO theory for a heteronuclear diatomic**

Use MO theory to determine the bond order and magnetic properties of NO. Compare the bond order and
Bond length of NO with those of $\mathrm{NO}^+$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

NO has 11 valence electrons (5 from N, 6 from O). Since oxygen is to the right of nitrogen in the
Periodic table, the $\mathrm{O}_2$/$\mathrm{F}_2$ energy ordering applies:

$$\sigma_{2s}^2\, (\sigma_{2s}^*)^2\, \sigma_{2p_z}^2\, \pi_{2p_x}^2\, \pi_{2p_y}^2\, (\pi_{2p_x}^*)^1$$

Bonding electrons: $2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10$. Antibonding electrons: $2 + 1 = 3$.

$$\mathrm{Bond\ order} = \frac{10 - 3}{2} = 3.5$$

One unpaired electron in $\pi_{2p_x}^*$: NO is **paramagnetic**.

**For $\mathrm{NO}^+$:** 10 valence electrons (one fewer than NO).

$$\sigma_{2s}^2\, (\sigma_{2s}^*)^2\, \sigma_{2p_z}^2\, \pi_{2p_x}^2\, \pi_{2p_y}^2$$

$$\mathrm{Bond\ order} = \frac{10 - 2}{2} = 4.0$$

$\mathrm{NO}^+$ has no unpaired electrons: **diamagnetic**.

**Comparison:** $\mathrm{NO}^+$ has a higher bond order (4.0 vs 3.5), so it has a shorter bond
length And higher bond dissociation energy than NO. Removing an electron from an antibonding orbital
Strengthens the bond.

</details>

**Worked Example: Sigma and pi bond counting**

How many sigma ($\sigma$) and pi ($\pi$) bonds are in a molecule of
$\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CHC}\equiv\mathrm{N}$? Identify the hybridization of each carbon
Atom.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Step 1: Draw the structure.**

$$\mathrm{CH_3 - CH = CH - C \equiv N}$$

**Step 2: Count bonds by type.**

**Worked Example: Band gap and semiconductor classification**

Diamond has a band gap of $5.5\mathrm{ eV}$ and silicon has a band gap of $1.1\mathrm{ eV}$. (a)
Calculate the minimum wavelength of light required to excite an electron across the band gap in each
Material. (b) Classify each material. (c) Explain why diamond is transparent to visible light but
Silicon is not.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Step 1: Calculate the threshold wavelengths.**

$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}$$

For diamond ($E = 5.5\mathrm{ eV} = 5.5 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\mathrm{ J}$):

$$\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{5.5 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1.988 \times 10^{-25}}{8.81 \times 10^{-19}} = 2.26 \times 10^{-7}\mathrm{ m} = 226\mathrm{ nm}$$

For silicon ($E = 1.1\mathrm{ eV}$):

$$\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.1 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1.988 \times 10^{-25}}{1.76 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.13 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{ m} = 1130\mathrm{ nm}$$

**Step 2: Classification.**

Diamond ($5.5\mathrm{ eV}$): **insulator** (band gap far exceeds thermal energy at room
temperature). Silicon ($1.1\mathrm{ eV}$): **semiconductor** (band gap comparable to visible photon
energies).

**Step 3: Transparency explanation.**

Visible light has wavelengths $400$--$700\mathrm{ nm}$. Diamond's threshold ($226\mathrm{ nm}$) is
in The ultraviolet, so all visible photons have insufficient energy to excite electrons across the
band Gap. Visible light passes through unabsorbed: diamond is transparent.

Silicon's threshold ($1130\mathrm{ nm}$) is in the infrared. All visible photons have more than
enough Energy to promote electrons to the conduction band, so visible light is absorbed. Silicon
appears Metallic-grey and opaque.

**Worked Example: Metallic bonding and melting point comparison**

Explain why tungsten ($\mathrm{W}$) has a melting point of $3422\degree\mathrm{C}$ while sodium
($\mathrm{Na}$) melts at $98\degree\mathrm{C}$Despite both being metals.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The strength of metallic bonding depends on three factors:

1. **Number of delocalized electrons per atom:**

- $\mathrm{W}$: electron configuration $[\mathrm{Xe}]\, 4f^{14}\, 5d^4\, 6s^2$Contributing up to 6
  valence electrons to the delocalized sea.
- $\mathrm{Na}$: configuration $[\mathrm{Ne}]\, 3s^1$Contributing only 1 valence electron.

2. **Ionic radius (charge density):**

- $\mathrm{W}^{6+}$ has a much smaller ionic radius than $\mathrm{Na}^+$ because tungsten is in
  Period 6 but has a much higher nuclear charge pulling electrons inward.
- Smaller ionic radius means the cations are closer to the electron sea, increasing electrostatic
  attraction.

3. **Ionic charge:**

- $\mathrm{W}$ can achieve high oxidation states ($+6$), creating cations with much greater charge
  density than $\mathrm{Na}^+$.

The combined effect of more delocalized electrons, smaller ionic radius, and higher ionic charge
Produces a much stronger metallic bond in tungsten. This is reflected in its extremely high melting
Point, hardness, and tensile strength compared to sodium.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Counting lone pairs incorrectly for VSEPR**: The steric number includes both bonding pairs and
  lone pairs. $\mathrm{NH}_3$ has 3 bonds + 1 lone pair = 4 regions, giving tetrahedral electron
  pair geometry and trigonal pyramidal molecular shape.

- **Misidentifying the central atom**: In molecules like $\mathrm{OF}_2$Oxygen is the central atom
  (less electronegative than fluorine). In $\mathrm{SCl}_4$Sulfur is central. Always place the least
  electronegative atom (excluding hydrogen) at the centre.

- **Assigning hybridization based on bonded atoms only**: Hybridization depends on the total steric
  number (bonded atoms + lone pairs). $\mathrm{NH}_3$ has steric number 4, so its hybridization is
  $sp^3$Not $sp^2$.

- **Reversing the MO energy ordering between $\mathrm{N}_2$ and $\mathrm{O}_2$**: For
  $\mathrm{B}_2$$\mathrm{C}_2$$\mathrm{N}_2$ (and lighter), $\pi_{2p}$ is lower than
  $\sigma_{2p_z}$. For $\mathrm{O}_2$$\mathrm{F}_2$$\mathrm{Ne}_2$The ordering reverses. The
  boundary is between $\mathrm{N}_2$ and $\mathrm{O}_2$.

- **Treating antibonding electrons as equivalent to bonding electrons**: Each antibonding electron
  weakens the bond by the same amount a bonding electron strengthens it. An electron in a $\pi^*$
  orbital reduces the bond order by 0.5.

- **Assuming metals always have high melting points**: Mercury ($\mathrm{Hg}$$Z = 80$) is a liquid
  at room temperature (m.p. $-39\degree\mathrm{C}$) because it has a large ionic radius and only 2
  valence electrons, producing weak metallic bonding despite being in Period 6.

- **Placing lone pairs in axial positions of trigonal bipyramidal**: Lone pairs always occupy
  equatorial positions to minimise $90\degree$ repulsions. Axial lone pairs would experience three
  $90\degree$ interactions; equatorial lone pairs experience only two.

- **Confusing $p$-type and $n$-type doping**: $n$-type means extra negative charge carriers
  (electrons from Group 15 dopant). $p$-type means positive charge carriers (holes from Group 13
  dopant). The dopant itself does not conduct; it provides carriers.

## Worked Examples (Expanded)

**Worked Example: Dipole Moment Calculation**

The $\mathrm{H\!-\!Cl}$ bond has a bond length of $127\;\mathrm{pm}$ and a bond dipole moment of
$1.08\;\mathrm{D}$. Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.
($1\;\mathrm{D} = 3.336 \times 10^{-30}\;\mathrm{C \cdot m}$; charge of electron
$= 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\;\mathrm{C}$)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

If the bond were $100\%$ ionic, the dipole moment would be:

$$\mu_{\mathrm{ionic}} = q \times d = (1.602 \times 10^{-19}\;\mathrm{C}) \times (127 \times 10^{-12}\;\mathrm{m}) = 2.035 \times 10^{-29}\;\mathrm{C \cdot m}$$

Converting to debye:
$$\mu_{\mathrm{ionic}} = \frac{2.035 \times 10^{-29}}{3.336 \times 10^{-30}} = 6.10\;\mathrm{D}$$

The actual dipole moment is $1.08\;\mathrm{D}$So the percent ionic character is:

$$\%\;\text{ionic} = \frac{1.08}{6.10} \times 100 = 17.7\%$$

This result demonstrates that even highly polar bonds like $\mathrm{H\!-\!Cl}$ have significant
covalent character. Purely ionic bonding is an idealisation; real bonds exist on a continuum.

**Worked Example: Lewis Structure and Formal Charge for an Unusual Species**

Draw the Lewis structure of $\mathrm{XeO}_3$Determine the formal charge on each atom, predict the
molecular geometry, and state whether the molecule is polar.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Step 1: Count valence electrons.** Xe: $8$ valence electrons. Each O: $6$ valence electrons.
Total: $8 + 3(6) = 26$ valence electrons.

**Step 2: Build the skeleton.** Xe is the central atom. Form single bonds to all three oxygens
(using 6 electrons). Distribute remaining electrons to satisfy octets: $26 - 6 = 20$ remaining. Each
oxygen needs 6 more electrons (3 lone pairs). That accounts for $3 \times 6 = 18$ electrons.
Remaining: $20 - 18 = 2$ electrons, which go on Xe as a lone pair.

**Step 3: Check formal charges.**

Formal charge $= V - N - B/2$ where $V$ = valence electrons, $N$ = non-bonding electrons, $B$ =
bonding electrons.

- Xe: $8 - 2 - 6/2 = 8 - 2 - 3 = +3$
- Each O: $6 - 6 - 2/2 = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1$

Net formal charge: $+3 + 3(-1) = 0$. This is valid but has high formal charges.

**Step 4: Minimise formal charges by forming double bonds.**

Convert one lone pair on each oxygen into a bonding pair, forming three Xe=O double bonds:

$$\mathrm{O}=\mathrm{Xe}(=\mathrm{O})_2 \text{ with one lone pair on Xe}$$

- Xe: $8 - 2 - 12/2 = 8 - 2 - 6 = 0$
- Each O: $6 - 4 - 4/2 = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0$

All formal charges are zero — this is the preferred structure.

**Step 5: Geometry and polarity.**

Steric number = 3 bonding regions + 1 lone pair = 4. Electron pair geometry: tetrahedral. Molecular
shape: **trigonal pyramidal**.

The Xe=O bonds are polar (Xe and O have different electronegativities), and the molecule lacks a
plane of symmetry (the lone pair breaks the symmetry). Therefore $\mathrm{XeO}_3$ is **polar**.

</details>

**Worked Example: Resonance and Bond Order in Polyatomic Ions**

Draw all significant resonance structures for the nitrate ion ($\mathrm{NO}_3^-$). Calculate the
average N--O bond order. Explain why the measured N--O bond length ($124\;\mathrm{pm}$) is
intermediate between a typical N--O single bond ($136\;\mathrm{pm}$) and N=O double bond
($115\;\mathrm{pm}$).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$\mathrm{NO}_3^-$ has $5 + 3(6) + 1 = 24$ valence electrons.

Three equivalent resonance structures can be drawn, each with one N=O double bond and two N--O
single bonds, with the double bond rotating among the three oxygen atoms. The negative charge is
delocalised over the three oxygens.

The **resonance hybrid** has partial double-bond character between N and each O.

$$\text{Bond order} = \frac{1\;\text{(double bond)} + 2\;\text{(single bonds)}}{3\;\text{(N--O bonds)}} = \frac{1 + 2}{3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1.33$$

The average bond order of $1.33$ means each N--O bond has approximately $1/3$ double-bond character
and $2/3$ single-bond character. The observed bond length of $124\;\mathrm{pm}$ is between the
single-bond ($136\;\mathrm{pm}$) and double-bond ($115\;\mathrm{pm}$) values, consistent with a bond
order of $1.33$.

This demonstrates a key principle of resonance: the real structure is an average of all resonance
forms, and the electron density is delocalised, producing bonds that are stronger and shorter than
single bonds.

**Worked Example: Lattice Energy and Born-Lande Equation**

Use the Kapustinskii equation to estimate the lattice energy of $\mathrm{KBr}$:

$$U = \frac{1200.2 \cdot z_+ z_- \cdot v}{r_+ + r_-}\left(1 - \frac{34.5}{r_+ + r_-}\right)\;\mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

Where $v$ is the number of ions per formula unit ($v = 2$ for $\mathrm{KBr}$), $r_+$ and $r_-$ are
ionic radii in pm, and $z_+, z_-$ are ion charges. Given:
$r(\mathrm{K}^+) = 138\;\mathrm{pm}$, $r(\mathrm{Br}^-) = 196\;\mathrm{pm}$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$$r_+ + r_- = 138 + 196 = 334\;\mathrm{pm}$$

$$U = \frac{1200.2 \times 1 \times 1 \times 2}{334}\left(1 - \frac{34.5}{334}\right)$$

$$U = \frac{2400.4}{334}\left(1 - 0.1033\right)$$

$$U = 7.187 \times 0.8967 = 6.445\;\mathrm{kJ/mol} \times 10^2 = 644.5\;\mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

Wait — the Kapustinskii equation as written gives the answer in $\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ directly when
radii are in pm:

$$U = \frac{1200.2 \times 2}{334}\left(1 - \frac{34.5}{334}\right) = \frac{2400.4}{334}(0.8967) = 7.187 \times 0.8967 = 6.44$$

$$U \approx -644\;\mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

The experimental lattice energy of $\mathrm{KBr}$ is approximately $-679\;\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. The
Kapustinskii estimate is within about $5\%$Demonstrating its utility for predicting lattice energies
when Born-Haber data are unavailable.

## Common Pitfalls (Expanded)

- **Counting lone pairs incorrectly for expanded octet species**: Elements in Period 3 and beyond
  can have more than 8 valence electrons (expanded octet). For $\mathrm{SF}_6$Sulfur has $12$
  valence electrons (6 bonds, 0 lone pairs). Do not force an octet on central atoms that can
  accommodate more.

- **Assuming that polar bonds always make a molecule polar**: $\mathrm{CCl}_4$$\mathrm{CO}_2$And
  $\mathrm{BF}_3$ all have polar bonds but are non-polar molecules because the bond dipoles cancel
  due to molecular symmetry. Always check the geometry before assigning polarity.

- **Misidentifying coordinate (dative) covalent bonds**: A coordinate bond is formed when both
  electrons in the bond come from the same atom. Once formed, a coordinate bond is indistinguishable
  from a normal covalent bond. In $\mathrm{NH}_4^+$The fourth N--H bond is a coordinate bond, but
  all four N--H bonds are equivalent in the ammonium ion.

- **Using the wrong MO energy ordering for heteronuclear diatomics**: For heteronuclear diatomics
  (e.g., $\mathrm{CO}$$\mathrm{NO}$), the energy levels are not exactly degenerate as in homonuclear
  diatomics. The more electronegative atom contributes lower-energy AOs, and the bonding orbitals
  are closer in energy to the AO of the more electronegative atom. However, for a rough analysis,
  the homonuclear ordering is often used as an approximation.

- **Confusing band gap with bond gap**: The band gap is a bulk solid-state property arising from the
  interaction of many atoms. It is not the same as the energy gap between bonding and antibonding
  molecular orbitals in a single molecule (which is related to bond dissociation energy).

- **Assuming all p-type dopants produce the same effect**: The effectiveness of doping depends on
  the concentration of dopant atoms and their energy levels relative to the valence band. Deep-level
  impurities (e.g., gold in silicon) create energy levels in the middle of the band gap and act as
  recombination centres, reducing carrier lifetime — the opposite of what is desired for
  semiconductor devices.

## Summary

This topic covers the essential chemistry of chemical bonding (advanced), including key reactions,
underlying theories, and practical applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding
- electronegativity and bond polarity
- intermolecular forces
- giant and simple molecular structures
- VSEPR theory

Mastery of these concepts requires both theoretical understanding and the ability to apply knowledge
to unfamiliar contexts, particularly in calculation and practical questions.
