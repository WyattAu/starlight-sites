## Drainage Basins and Hydrology

## The Drainage Basin System

### Definition and Boundaries

A drainage basin (catchment or watershed) is the area of land from which all precipitation flows to
A common outlet, where a river enters a lake, sea, or ocean. The boundary of a drainage Basin is the
watershed (drainage divide), a line of high ground separating one basin from another. The drainage
basin is an open system: energy and matter enter, are transformed within the system, And leave.

### System Components

| Component             | Description                      | Examples                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inputs**            | Water entering the system        | Precipitation (rainfall, snow, hail, sleet), intercepted water, groundwater inflow from adjacent basins                                                                         |
| **Outputs**           | Water leaving the system         | Evaporation, transpiration, river discharge to the sea, groundwater outflow                                                                                                     |
| **Stores**            | Water held within the system     | Vegetation canopy interception, surface storage (puddles, lakes, ponds), soil moisture, groundwater (aquifers, unconfined and confined), channel storage, snowpack and glaciers |
| **Transfers (flows)** | Movement of water between stores | Throughfall, stemflow, overland flow (Hortonian flow), infiltration, percolation, throughflow (interflow), pipeflow, groundwater flow (baseflow), channel flow                  |

### The Hydrological Cycle at Basin Scale

The hydrological cycle operates at the drainage basin scale through a series of interconnected
Flows. Precipitation falling on the basin is intercepted by vegetation (interception store) or
Reaches the ground surface. Water on the surface may infiltrate into the soil (soil moisture store)
Or flow over the surface as overland flow. Infiltrated water moves through the soil as throughflow
Or percolates downward to recharge groundwater (groundwater store). Groundwater moves slowly toward
The river channel as baseflow. Water is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation from open
Water and soil surfaces, and transpiration from vegetation.

The relative importance of each flow pathway depends on the physical characteristics of the basin
(climate, geology, soil type, slope, vegetation cover) and human modifications (urbanisation,
Deforestation, drainage, irrigation).

### The Water Balance Equation

The water balance of a drainage basin over a specified time period is:

$$P = Q + E \pm \Delta S$$

Where $P$ is total precipitation, $Q$ is total runoff (river discharge), $E$ is total
Evapotranspiration, and $\Delta S$ is the change in all storage components combined. Over a long
Period ( the hydrological year), $\Delta S$ approaches zero, yielding:

$$P = Q + E$$

This identity states that all precipitation is ultimately partitioned between runoff and
Evapotranspiration. The ratio $Q/P$ is the runoff coefficient, which indicates the proportion of
Precipitation that becomes streamflow. In arid regions, $E/P$ approaches 1 (almost all precipitation
Returns to the atmosphere). In humid regions with impermeable geology, $Q/P$ may exceed 0.6.

## Storm Hydrograph Interpretation

### Components of a Storm Hydrograph

A storm hydrograph (flood hydrograph) plots river discharge ( in m$^3$/s on the y-axis) Against time
( hours on the x-axis) for a specific rainfall event. The key features are:

- **Baseflow:** the sustained, relatively constant flow maintained by groundwater discharge into the
  channel between storm events.
- **Rising limb:** the period during which discharge increases following the onset of rainfall, as
  water from various sources reaches the channel.
- **Peak discharge:** the maximum instantaneous discharge during the storm event.
- **Lag time:** the interval between the centroid of rainfall (or the peak rainfall intensity) and
  the peak discharge. Short lag times indicate rapid runoff generation; long lag times indicate
  slow, delayed response.
- **Falling limb (recession curve):** the period during which discharge declines as the river drains
  water stored in the channel, on the floodplain, and in the subsurface. The recession curve is
  often approximately exponential.
- **Bankfull discharge:** the discharge at which water overtops the channel banks and begins to flow
  across the floodplain.

### Hydrograph Shape and Runoff Generation

The shape of the storm hydrograph reflects the relative contributions of different runoff sources. A
**flashy hydrograph** has a short lag time, steep rising limb, high narrow peak, and rapid
Recession, indicating that overland flow dominates. A **damped hydrograph** has a long lag time,
Gentle rising limb, broader and lower peak, and extended recession, indicating that throughflow and
Baseflow dominate.

The **unit hydrograph** technique, developed by Sherman (1932), is a standard method for predicting
The hydrograph response of a drainage basin to a given rainfall input. The unit hydrograph is the
Hydrograph resulting from 1 unit (e.g., 1 cm) of effective rainfall (rainfall that contributes to
Runoff, after accounting for losses to infiltration and interception) falling uniformly over the
Basin within a specified duration. The principle of superposition allows the unit hydrograph to be
Scaled and combined to predict the hydrograph for any storm.

## Factors Affecting Storm Hydrographs

### Physical Factors

| Factor                       | Effect on Hydrograph                                                                                      | Mechanism                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Rainfall intensity**       | Shorter lag time, steeper rising limb, higher peak discharge                                              | Intense rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity rapidly, generating overland flow (Hortonian overland flow)               |
| **Rainfall duration**        | Longer lag time possible, broader peak, higher total runoff volume                                        | Prolonged rainfall saturates the soil progressively, reducing infiltration capacity over time                            |
| **Antecedent soil moisture** | Wet antecedent conditions: short lag time, high peak; dry conditions: long lag time, lower peak           | Saturated or near-saturated soil has limited capacity to absorb additional water, so a greater proportion becomes runoff |
| **Geology**                  | Impermeable rock (clay, granite): flashy hydrograph; permeable rock (chalk, sandstone): damped hydrograph | Permeable rock promotes deep infiltration and groundwater storage, delaying runoff                                       |
| **Soil type**                | Clay soils: flashy; sandy/loam soils: damped                                                              | Clay soils have low infiltration rates; sandy soils drain rapidly, promoting infiltration                                |
| **Slope angle**              | Steep slopes: short lag time, high peak discharge                                                         | Gravity accelerates overland flow on steep slopes, reducing the time for infiltration                                    |
| **Drainage density**         | High density: short lag time, flashy response                                                             | A dense network of channels collects water rapidly and delivers it to the main channel                                   |
| **Basin size and shape**     | Large basin: longer lag time; elongated basin: longer lag time; circular basin: shorter lag time          | Water from distant parts of large or elongated basins takes longer to reach the outlet                                   |
| **Vegetation cover**         | Dense vegetation: long lag time, lower peak discharge                                                     | Interception reduces effective rainfall; root systems increase infiltration; transpiration reduces soil moisture         |

### Human Factors

**Urbanisation.** Urbanisation profoundly alters the hydrological response of a drainage basin. The
Replacement of permeable vegetated surfaces with impermeable surfaces (concrete, asphalt, rooftops)
Reduces infiltration, increases overland flow, and accelerates the delivery of water to drainage
Channels. Stormwater drainage systems (gullies, pipes, culverts) further concentrate and accelerate
Flow. The net effect is a shorter lag time, higher peak discharge, and more frequent and severe
Flooding. Studies in the UK have found that urbanisation can increase peak discharge by 2--5 times
Compared to equivalent rural basins.

**Deforestation.** Removing trees reduces interception (which can account for 10--40% of gross
Rainfall in dense forests), decreases transpiration, and reduces root-mediated soil structure and
Infiltration capacity. Research in the Himalayas and Amazon basin has demonstrated that
Deforestation increases overland flow, reduces baseflow, and makes streamflow more seasonal (higher
Peaks in the wet season, lower flows in the dry season).

**Agricultural drainage.** Land drainage (under-drainage with perforated pipes, open ditches) is
Installed to lower the water table and improve agricultural productivity. However, it accelerates
The movement of water through the soil profile, increasing the volume and speed of throughflow
Reaching the channel, resulting in a shorter lag time and higher peak discharge.

<details>
<summary>Common Pitfalls: Confusing Overland Flow Types</summary>

Two distinct mechanisms generate overland flow, and confusing them is a frequent error. **Hortonian
Overland flow** occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil,
Generating surface runoff regardless of how much water the soil can hold in total. This is common in
Arid and semi-arid environments, urban areas, and compacted soils. **Saturation overland flow**
(also called the Dunne mechanism) occurs when the soil profile becomes saturated from below (e.g.,
By rising groundwater or throughflow convergence at the base of slopes), and any additional rainfall
Cannot infiltrate and flows over the surface. This is common in humid environments with shallow
Soils. In many temperate environments, saturation overland flow is the dominant mechanism, not
Hortonian overland flow. Always specify which mechanism you are describing.

## Case Study: The River Severn, UK

The River Severn (approximately 354 km) is the longest river in the UK, draining a basin of
Approximately 11 400 km$^2$ in mid-Wales and western England. The hydrology of the Severn
Illustrates the interaction of physical factors across a heterogeneous basin.

**Upper Severn (Plynlimon).** The headwaters rise on the Ordovician and Silurian shales of the
Cambrian Mountains at elevations above 600 m. The steep slopes, impermeable geology, and high
Rainfall (approximately 2500 mm per year) produce a flashy hydrological response. The Institute of
Hydrology operated experimental catchments at Plynlimon from the 1960s to the 1980s, comparing the
Hydrology of the afforested Severn catchment (conifer plantation) with the adjacent grassland Wye
Catchment. Key findings included: the forested catchment had higher interception losses
(approximately 30% of gross rainfall, compared to approximately 10% for grassland), lower annual
Runoff, and more moderated peak flows during moderate storms. However, during extreme storms, the
Forested catchment produced similar peak discharges because the canopy became saturated and
Interception capacity was exhausted.

**Middle and Lower Severn.** As the river crosses the lowlands of the Severn Valley, the geology
Becomes more varied (Permo-Triassic sandstones, which are highly permeable and store large volumes
Of groundwater). Baseflow contribution increases, and the hydrograph becomes less flashy. The Severn
Is prone to flooding in its middle and lower reaches, particularly at Shrewsbury, Worcester, and
Gloucester. The autumn and winter floods of 2019--2020 produced the highest recorded flows on the
Severn at several gauging stations, attributed to a succession of storms (Storm Ciara, Storm Dennis)
Falling on already-saturated ground.

## Case Study: The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Basin

The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin, draining approximately 1.7 million km$^2$ across India,
Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and China, illustrates how basin-scale hydrology is shaped by extreme
Climate variability and large-scale physical processes.

**Seasonal hydrology.** The GBM basin has a strongly seasonal hydrological regime driven by the
South Asian monsoon. Approximately 80% of annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon season
(June--September). Discharge on the Ganges at Farakka (the downstream gauging station before it
Enters Bangladesh) varies from approximately 500 m$^3$/s in the dry season (March--May) to over 70
000 m$^3$/s during the monsoon peak. The Brahmaputra at Bahadurabad shows even greater variation,
From approximately 3000 m$^3$/s to over 100 000 m$^3$/s.

**Snow and glacial melt.** The upper reaches of both the Ganges and Brahmaputra receive significant
Contributions from snow and glacial melt from the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. Meltwater
Contributes approximately 10% of annual flow of the Ganges, but this proportion can reach 30--40%
During the pre-monsoon period (April--June), when meltwater is critical for irrigation in the
Gangetic Plain.

**Flooding.** The confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra in Bangladesh, combined with monsoonal
Rainfall and Himalayan snowmelt, produces catastrophic flooding almost annually. The 1998 flood
Inundated approximately 100 000 km$^2$ of Bangladesh (approximately 70% of the country), affecting
Over 30 million people, destroying approximately 500 000 homes, and causing estimated damage of
Approximately USD 2 billion. The 2022 floods affected approximately 7.2 million people in
Bangladesh"s northeastern Sylhet region.

## Hydrological Fieldwork and Skills

### Measuring Discharge

River discharge ($Q$) is calculated as:

$$Q = w \times \bar{d} \times \bar{v}$$

Where $w$ is channel width, $\bar{d}$ is mean depth, and $\bar{v}$ is mean velocity. Velocity is
Measured using a flow meter (impeller or electromagnetic) at multiple points across the channel ( at
0.6 of the depth from the surface, or as the average of measurements at 0.2 and 0.8 of The depth for
deeper channels). The velocity-area method integrates velocity measurements across the Channel
cross-section.

### Hydrograph Analysis

Key analytical skills for IB Geography include:

- **Calculating lag time** from a hydrograph by measuring the time interval between peak rainfall
  and peak discharge.
- **Identifying the proportion of baseflow vs stormflow** by separating the hydrograph into its
  components (a straight line drawn from the point where the rising limb begins to the point where
  the recession curve returns to baseflow level).
- **Comparing hydrographs** for different storm events or different drainage basins and explaining
  the differences in terms of physical and human factors.
- **Relating hydrograph characteristics to flood risk**, recognising that flashy hydrographs with
  short lag times and high peak discharges pose a greater flood risk than damped hydrographs.

<details>
<summary>Common Pitfalls: Assuming a Single Factor Controls Hydrograph Shape</summary>

Examination questions frequently ask students to explain the shape of a given hydrograph. A common
Error is to attribute the hydrograph shape to a single factor (e.g., "the basin is urban, so the
Hydrograph is flashy"). In reality, the hydrograph shape results from the interaction of multiple
Factors. A strong answer will identify the dominant factor and then explain how other factors modify
Its effect. For example, "The short lag time is primarily due to the impermeable clay geology, which
Limits infiltration. However, the mature forest cover partially offsets this by intercepting
Rainfall and increasing infiltration through root action, which explains why the peak discharge is
Lower than would be expected for bare clay."

## Intuition

A drainage basin is a complete water machine: precipitation enters, water is stored and transformed in multiple reservoirs, and discharge exits. The storm hydrograph is the basin's fingerprint, revealing how quickly or slowly it delivers water to the channel. Urbanisation strips away the basin's natural sponges -- soil and vegetation -- and replaces them with concrete pipes that rush water downstream. The water balance equation is conservation of matter applied to hydrology: what goes in must come out or be stored somewhere.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Incorrectly applying integration by parts by choosing $u$ and $\frac{dv}{dx}$ the wrong way
   around.

2. Forgetting the $+c$ constant of integration in indefinite integrals, or misusing boundary
   conditions in definite integrals.

3. Dropping negative signs during algebraic manipulation. Substitute back to verify your answer.

4. Rounding too early in multi-step calculations. Carry full precision through and round only the
   final answer.
