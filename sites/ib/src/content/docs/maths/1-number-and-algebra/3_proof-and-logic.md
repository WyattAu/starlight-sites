## Proof and Logic

This note covers **IB Mathematics AA — Topic 1.4: Proof** in full depth. Everything here is
Examinable at both Standard Level and Higher Level, with HL extensions marked where relevant.

## 1. Logic Foundations

### 1.1 Propositions and Truth Values

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false** — never both, never
Neither.

"7 is prime" is a proposition (true). "Solve for x" is not a proposition. "This sentence is false"
Is not a proposition (it is paradoxical).

The truth value of a proposition $P$ is denoted $\mathcal{T}(P) \in \{T, F\}$.

### 1.2 Logical Connectives

There are five fundamental connectives. Let $P$ and $Q$ be propositions.

| Connective    | Symbol         | Read as              | Meaning                                 |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Negation      | $\neg P$       | "not P"              | True when P is false                    |
| Conjunction   | $P \wedge Q$   | "P and Q"            | True when both are true                 |
| Disjunction   | $P \vee Q$     | "P or Q"             | True when at least one is true          |
| Implication   | $P \implies Q$ | "P implies Q"        | False only when P true and Q false      |
| Biconditional | $P \iff Q$     | "P if and only if Q" | True when P and Q have same truth value |

#### Truth Tables

**Negation:**

| $P$ | $\neg P$ |
| :-: | :------: |
|  T  |    F     |
|  F  |    T     |

**Conjunction:**

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \wedge Q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :----------: |
|  T  |  T  |      T       |
|  T  |  F  |      F       |
|  F  |  T  |      F       |
|  F  |  F  |      F       |

**Disjunction (inclusive OR):**

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \vee Q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :--------: |
|  T  |  T  |     T      |
|  T  |  F  |     T      |
|  F  |  T  |     T      |
|  F  |  F  |     F      |

**Implication:**

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \implies Q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :------------: |
|  T  |  T  |       T        |
|  T  |  F  |       F        |
|  F  |  T  |       T        |
|  F  |  F  |       T        |

The implication $P \implies Q$ is only false when a true premise leads to a false conclusion. This
Is the single most misunderstood truth table entry in all of mathematics. When $P$ is false, the
Implication is **vacuously true** — there is no counterexample to "whenever P holds, Q holds."

**Biconditional:**

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \iff Q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :--------: |
|  T  |  T  |     T      |
|  T  |  F  |     F      |
|  F  |  T  |     F      |
|  F  |  F  |     T      |

### 1.3 Logical Equivalence

Two compound propositions are **logically equivalent** (written $\equiv$) if they have identical
Truth values for every possible assignment of truth values to their component propositions.

**Key equivalences (Laws of Logic):**

1. **Commutative:** $P \wedge Q \equiv Q \wedge P$And $P \vee Q \equiv Q \vee P$
2. **Associative:** $(P \wedge Q) \wedge R \equiv P \wedge (Q \wedge R)$And similarly for $\vee$
3. **Distributive:** $P \wedge (Q \vee R) \equiv (P \wedge Q) \vee (P \wedge R)$And
   $P \vee (Q \wedge R) \equiv (P \vee Q) \wedge (P \vee R)$
4. **Identity:** $P \wedge T \equiv P$And $P \vee F \equiv P$
5. **Domination:** $P \vee T \equiv T$And $P \wedge F \equiv F$
6. **Idempotent:** $P \wedge P \equiv P$And $P \vee P \equiv P$
7. **Double Negation:** $\neg(\neg P) \equiv P$
8. **Absorption:** $P \vee (P \wedge Q) \equiv P$And $P \wedge (P \vee Q) \equiv P$

### 1.4 De Morgan"s Laws

These are essential for negating compound statements.

$$\neg(P \wedge Q) \equiv \neg P \vee \neg Q$$

$$\neg(P \vee Q) \equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q$$

**Intuition:** To negate an "and," negate each part and switch to "or." To negate an "or," negate
Each part and switch to "and."

**Worked Example — Negating a compound statement:**

Negate: "The function $f$ is continuous and differentiable."

Let $C$: "$f$ is continuous." Let $D$: "$f$ is differentiable." The statement is $C \wedge D$. Its
Negation is $\neg C \vee \neg D$I.e., "$f$ is either not continuous or not differentiable."

<aside aria-label="A common mistake is to negate "P and Q" as "not P and not Q." That is wrong. The negation of" class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note"><p class="starlight-aside__title" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="starlight-aside__icon" aria-hidden="true" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor"><path d="M12 2a10 10 0 1 0 0 20 10 10 0 0 0 0-20Zm0 14a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Zm1-5a1 1 0 0 1-2 0V8a1 1 0 0 1 2 0v2Z"/></svg>A common mistake is to negate "P and Q" as "not P and not Q." That is wrong. The negation of</p>
"$f$ is continuous and differentiable" is NOT "$f$ is not continuous and not differentiable" — that
Is too strong.
</aside>
### 1.5 The Contrapositive

For any implication $P \implies Q$The **contrapositive** is $\neg Q \implies \neg P$.

**Theorem:** An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.

$$P \implies Q \equiv \neg Q \implies \neg P$$

This is proved by comparing truth tables. Both are false only when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.

Compare with two other related statements that are NOT equivalent:

- The **converse** of $P \implies Q$ is $Q \implies P$ (not equivalent )
- The **inverse** of $P \implies Q$ is $\neg P \implies \neg Q$ (not equivalent , but equivalent to
  the converse)

> **Danger:** Danger Implication. Never confuse the contrapositive with the converse.
**Worked Example:**

Statement: "If $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even."

Contrapositive: "If $n^2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd."

Converse: "If $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even." (True in this case, but not logically guaranteed.)

Inverse: "If $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd." (Also true here, but again not guaranteed.)

### 1.6 Tautologies and Contradictions

A **tautology** is a compound proposition that is true for every possible truth assignment. A
**contradiction** is a compound proposition that is false for every possible truth assignment.

**Important tautology:** $P \vee \neg P$ (Law of Excluded Middle)

**Important contradiction:** $P \wedge \neg P$

**Another key tautology — Modus Ponens:** $((P \implies Q) \wedge P) \implies Q$

This says: if you know $P \implies Q$ and you know $P$Then you can conclude $Q$. This is the
Fundamental rule of direct .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic.

**Modus Tollens:** $((P \implies Q) \wedge \neg Q) \implies \neg P$

This says: if you know $P \implies Q$ and you know $\neg Q$Then you can conclude $\neg P$. This is
The fundamental rule of .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic by contrapositive.

### 1.7 Quantifiers

Quantifiers let us express statements about collections of objects.

**Universal quantifier** ($\forall$): "For all" — the statement must hold for every element in the
Domain.

$$\forall x \in S, \; P(x)$$

**Existential quantifier** ($\exists$): "There exists" — the statement must hold for at least one
Element.

$$\exists x \in S, \; P(x)$$

**Negating quantified statements:**

$$\neg(\forall x, \; P(x)) \equiv \exists x, \; \neg P(x)$$

$$\neg(\exists x, \; P(x)) \equiv \forall x, \; \neg P(x)$$

To negate a universal statement, you get an existential counterexample. To negate an existential
Statement, you must show it fails for every case.

**Nested quantifiers** require careful handling. The order matters:

$$\forall x \, \exists y, \; P(x,y) \quad \mathrm{is NOT equivalent to} \quad \exists y \, \forall x, \; P(x,y)$$

**Worked Example — Negating a nested quantifier statement:**

Negate: "For every positive real number $\varepsilon$There exists a positive real number $\delta$
Such that..."

$$\neg\left(\forall \varepsilon \gt 0, \; \exists \delta \gt 0, \; P(\varepsilon, \delta)\right) \equiv \exists \varepsilon \gt 0, \; \forall \delta \gt 0, \; \neg P(\varepsilon, \delta)$$

The existential becomes universal and the universal becomes existential. This is the logical
Backbone of epsilon-delta definitions in analysis.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
same sequence but With each quantifier flipped.
</aside>
<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Negate $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, \; \exists p \mathrm{ prime}, \; p \gt n$</summary>

Step 1: Identify the structure — it is $\forall n, \; \exists p, \; P(n,p)$ where $P(n,p)$ is "$p$
Is prime and $p \gt n$."

Step 2: Negate — $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, \; \forall p \mathrm{ prime}, \; \neg(p \gt n)$

Step 3: Simplify — $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, \; \forall p \mathrm{ prime}, \; p \le n$

Reading: "There exists a positive integer $n$ such that every prime $p$ satisfies $p \le n$." This
Is false (there are infinitely many primes), so the original statement is true.

## 2. Methods of Proof

### 2.1 Direct Proof

**Strategy:** To prove $P \implies Q$Assume $P$ is true and use logical deduction to arrive at $Q$.

This is the most straightforward method. You chain together known results, definitions, and
Algebraic manipulations.

**Template:**

1. Assume $P$.
2. [Logical steps...]
3. Therefore $Q$.
4. Hence $P \implies Q$.

**Worked Example — If $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd:**

Assume $n$ is odd. By definition, $n = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$$n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$$

Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is an integer (sum and product of integers), let $m = 2k^2 + 2k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then $n^2 = 2m + 1$Which is odd by definition.

Therefore, if $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.

**Worked Example — The sum of two even numbers is even:**

Let $a = 2m$ and $b = 2n$ for some $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$$a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n)$$

Since $m + n \in \mathbb{Z}$We have $a + b = 2(m+n)$ is even.

<details>
<summary>Exercise: Prove that the product of two odd numbers is odd.</summary>

Let $a = 2m + 1$ and $b = 2n + 1$ for some $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$a \cdot b = (2m+1)(2n+1) = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1 = 2(2mn + m + n) + 1$

Since $2mn + m + n \in \mathbb{Z}$The product is of the form $2k + 1$Hence odd.

</details>

### 2.2 Proof by Contradiction

**Strategy:** To prove a statement $P$Assume $\neg P$ and derive a logical contradiction (something
that is always false, like $1 = 0$ or $0 \lt 0$).

**Template:**

1. Assume $\neg P$ (the negation of what you want to prove).
2. [Logical steps leading to a contradiction...]
3. This contradicts [known fact].
4. Therefore $\neg P$ is false, so $P$ is true.

This method is especially powerful when the statement you want to prove is a negation itself ("there
Does not exist..." or "there are no...").

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
Middle ($P \vee \neg P$ must be true).
</aside>
**Worked Example — $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational:**

Assume $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^+$
$\gcd(a, b) = 1$ (the fraction is in lowest terms).

Squaring both sides: $2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$So $a^2 = 2b^2$.

Since $a^2 = 2b^2$We have $a^2$ is even. Therefore $a$ is even (by the lemma: if $a^2$ is even, Then
$a$ is even — proved below).

Write $a = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Substituting:

$(2k)^2 = 2b^2$So $4k^2 = 2b^2$So $b^2 = 2k^2$.

Therefore $b^2$ is even, so $b$ is even.

But now both $a$ and $b$ are even, contradicting $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.

Therefore our assumption is false, and $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
$a^2$ is Even, $a$ cannot be odd, so $a$ is even.
</aside>
<details>
<summary>Exercise: Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.</summary>

Assume $\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}$ in lowest terms. Then $a^2 = 3b^2$So $a^2$ is divisible by 3. By The
lemma (if $3 \mid a^2$Then $3 \mid a$), write $a = 3k$. Then $9k^2 = 3b^2$So $b^2 = 3k^2$ Hence
$3 \mid b^2$So $3 \mid b$. Both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3, contradicting lowest terms.

The supporting lemma "if $p \mid a^2$ for prime $p$Then $p \mid a$" follows from the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic: if $p$ appears in the prime factorization of $a^2$It must appear in the
Factorization of $a$.

</details>

### 2.3 Proof by Contrapositive

**Strategy:** To prove $P \implies Q$Instead prove $\neg Q \implies \neg P$. Since an implication Is
logically equivalent to its contrapositive, this proves the original statement.

**When to use this:** When the hypothesis $P$ feels "too big" or "too loose" to work with directly,
But the negation of the conclusion $\neg Q$ gives you something concrete to grab.

**Template:**

1. We prove the contrapositive: if $\neg Q$Then $\neg P$.
2. Assume $\neg Q$.
3. [Logical steps...]
4. Therefore $\neg P$.
5. Hence $P \implies Q$.

**Worked Example — If $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even:**

We prove the contrapositive: if $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.

Assume $n$ is odd. Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$

This is odd. Therefore, if $n$ is odd, $n^2$ is odd. By contrapositive, if $n^2$ is even, then $n$
Is even.

<summary>Exercise: Prove that if $3n + 2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd (by contrapositive).</summary>

Contrapositive: If $n$ is even, then $3n + 2$ is even.

Assume $n$ is even, so $n = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$3n + 2 = 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)$

Since $3k + 1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, $3n + 2$ is even. By contrapositive, if $3n + 2$ is odd, then $n$ is
Odd.

### 2.4 Mathematical Induction

Induction proves statements of the form $\forall n \ge n_0, \; P(n)$Where $n_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

#### 2.4.1 Standard (Weak) Induction

**Template:**

1. **Base case:** Verify $P(n_0)$ is true.
2. **Inductive hypothesis:** Assume $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary $k \ge n_0$.
3. **Inductive step:** Using the hypothesis that $P(k)$ holds, prove that $P(k+1)$ holds.
4. **Conclusion:** By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge n_0$.

**Worked Example — Sum formula $1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$:**

Let $P(n)$: $1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

**Base case ($n = 1$):** LHS $= 1$RHS $= \frac{1 \cdot 2}{2} = 1$. So $P(1)$ is true.

**Inductive hypothesis:** Assume $P(k)$ is true for some $k \ge 1$I.e.,
$1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.

**Inductive step:** We must show $P(k+1)$: $1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$.

Starting from the LHS:

$$1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)$$

(by the inductive hypothesis)

$$= \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k + 2)}{2}$$

This is exactly the RHS of $P(k+1)$. Therefore $P(k+1)$ holds.

**Conclusion:** By induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 1$.

**Worked Example — Sum of squares $1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$:**

Let $P(n)$: $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.

**Base case ($n = 1$):** LHS $= 1$RHS $= \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}{6} = 1$. True.

**Inductive hypothesis:** Assume $P(k)$ holds for some $k \ge 1$.

**Inductive step:**

$$\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} i^2 + (k+1)^2 = \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} + (k+1)^2$$

$$= \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1) + 6(k+1)^2}{6}$$

$$= \frac{(k+1)[k(2k+1) + 6(k+1)]}{6}$$

$$= \frac{(k+1)[2k^2 + k + 6k + 6]}{6}$$

$$= \frac{(k+1)(2k^2 + 7k + 6)}{6}$$

$$= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)}{6}$$

$$= \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+1)}{6}$$

This is $P(k+1)$. By induction, the formula holds for all $n \ge 1$.

<details>
<summary>Exercise: Prove by induction that $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2$ for all $n \ge 1$.</summary>

Let $P(n)$: $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - 1) = n^2$.

Base case ($n = 1$): LHS $= 1$RHS $= 1$. True.

Inductive hypothesis: Assume $P(k)$: $1 + 3 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2$.

Inductive step: $1 + 3 + \cdots + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) = k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2$.

By induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \ge 1$.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Exercise: Prove by induction that $2^n \gt n$ for all $n \ge 1$.</summary>

Let $P(n)$: $2^n \gt n$.

Base case ($n = 1$): $2^1 = 2 \gt 1$. True.

Inductive hypothesis: Assume $2^k \gt k$ for some $k \ge 1$.

Inductive step: $2^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 2^k \gt 2k$ (by IH, since $2^k \gt k$ and multiplying by 2).

Now, $2k = k + k \ge k + 1$ for $k \ge 1$. Therefore $2^{k+1} \gt k + 1$.

By induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \ge 1$.

</details>

#### 2.4.2 Strong Induction

In strong induction, the inductive hypothesis assumes $P(n_0), P(n_0+1), \ldots, P(k)$ are ALL true,
Not just $P(k)$.

**Template:**

1. **Base case(s):** Verify $P(n_0)$ (and possibly more base cases).
2. **Inductive hypothesis:** Assume $P(j)$ is true for all $n_0 \le j \le k$.
3. **Inductive step:** Using that $P(j)$ holds for all $j \le k$Prove $P(k+1)$.
4. **Conclusion:** By the Principle of Strong Induction, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge n_0$.

**When to use strong induction:** When proving $P(k+1)$ requires not just $P(k)$ but some earlier
Case $P(j)$ where $j \lt k$.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
By the other. But strong induction can make certain .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logics much
more natural. Use it when the Inductive step needs to reference cases earlier than just $k$.
</aside>
**Worked Example — Every integer $n \ge 2$ is a product of primes:**

Let $P(n)$: "$n$ is a product of primes (possibly a single prime)."

**Base case ($n = 2$):** 2 is prime, hence a product of primes. True.

**Strong inductive hypothesis:** Assume $P(j)$ is true for all $2 \le j \le k$.

**Inductive step for $n = k + 1$:**

Case 1: $k+1$ is prime. Then it is a product of primes.

Case 2: $k+1$ is composite. Then $k+1 = ab$ where $2 \le a \le b \le k$. By the strong inductive
Hypothesis, both $a$ and $b$ are products of primes. Therefore $k+1 = ab$ is a product of primes.

In either case, $P(k+1)$ holds. By strong induction, every integer $n \ge 2$ is a product of primes.

<summary>Exercise: Prove that every amount of postage $\ge 4$ cents can be formed using 4-cent and 5-cent stamps.</summary>

Let $P(n)$: "Postage of $n$ cents can be formed using 4-cent and 5-cent stamps."

Base cases: $P(4)$: one 4-cent stamp. $P(5)$: one 5-cent stamp. $P(6)$: cannot — wait, this needs
Checking. $P(7)$: cannot either. Let me reconsider.

Actually, we need $P(8)$: two 4-cent stamps. $P(9)$: one 4-cent + one 5-cent. $P(10)$: two 5-cent
Stamps. $P(11)$: ... Hmm, $P(12)$: three 4-cent stamps. $P(13)$: two 4-cent + one 5-cent. $P(14)$:
One 4-cent + two 5-cent. $P(15)$: three 5-cent stamps.

Let us use base cases $P(12)$, $P(13)$, $P(14)$, $P(15)$. Strong inductive hypothesis: assume $P(j)$
For all $12 \le j \le k$Where $k \ge 15$.

For $P(k+1)$: note that $(k+1) - 4 = k - 3 \ge 12$ (since $k \ge 15$). By strong IH, $P(k-3)$ holds,
Meaning we can form $(k-3)$ cents. Adding one 4-cent stamp gives $(k-3) + 4 = k+1$ cents.

By strong induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \ge 12$. But we should verify the smaller cases: $P(4)$
Through $P(11)$. We find $P(4)$, $P(5)$, $P(8)$, $P(9)$$P(10)$ hold, but $P(6)$$P(7)$$P(11)$ Do not.
So the correct statement is: all postage $n \ge 8$ except $n = 11$. Or: all $n \ge 12$.

The cleanest formulation: all $n \ge 12$ can be formed. Base cases $P(12)$ through $P(15)$.
Inductive step as above.

### 2.5 Proof by Exhaustion

**Strategy:** When the domain of possible cases is finite and small, prove the statement by
Verifying each case individually.

This is brute-force but rigorous. It is only practical when the number of cases is manageable.

**Worked Example — Show that $n^2 + n + 17$ is prime for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$:**

$n = 0$: $0 + 0 + 17 = 17$ (prime) $n = 1$: $1 + 1 + 17 = 19$ (prime) $n = 2$: $4 + 2 + 17 = 23$
(prime) $n = 3$: $9 + 3 + 17 = 29$ (prime) $n = 4$: $16 + 4 + 17 = 37$ (prime)

All five cases verified. (Note: this polynomial produces primes for $n = 0$ through $n = 15$But
Fails at $n = 16$ since $16^2 + 16 + 17 = 289 = 17^2$.)

### 2.6 Counterexamples

A single counterexample is sufficient to disprove a universal statement.

**Strategy:** To disprove $\forall x \in S, \; P(x)$Find one $a \in S$ such that $P(a)$ is false.

**Worked Example — Disprove: "All prime numbers are odd."**

Counterexample: $2$ is prime and $2$ is even.

**Worked Example — Disprove: "$n^2 - n + 41$ is prime for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$."**

When $n = 41$: $41^2 - 41 + 41 = 41^2 = 1681$Which is composite ($41 \times 41$).

## 3. Classical Proof Examples

### 3.1 $\sqrt{2}$ is Irrational (Detailed)

This .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic appeared in Section 2.2. Here we present it with
full commentary on every logical step.

**Theorem:** $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$.

**Proof:**

We proceed by contradiction.

Assume $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then there exist coprime integers $a, b$ with $b \gt 0$ such that
$\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$.

The requirement that $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ is without loss of generality: any rational number can be
Expressed as a fraction in lowest terms.

Squaring: $2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$So $a^2 = 2b^2$. Equation (1).

From (1): $a^2$ is divisible by 2, so $a^2$ is even. By the contrapositive of "odd implies square is
Odd," $a$ is even.

Since $a$ is even, write $a = 2m$ for some integer $m$. Substituting into (1):

$(2m)^2 = 2b^2$I.e., $4m^2 = 2b^2$I.e., $b^2 = 2m^2$. Equation (2).

From (2): $b^2$ is even, so $b$ is even (same reasoning as above).

But now $a$ and $b$ are both even, meaning $\gcd(a, b) \ge 2$Contradicting $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.

This contradiction shows our assumption is false. Hence $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$. $\blacksquare$

### 3.2 There Are Infinitely Many Primes

**Theorem (Euclid):** The set of prime numbers is infinite.

**Proof:**

We proceed by contradiction.

Assume there are only finitely many primes: $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.

Consider the number $N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$.

Since $N \gt 1$By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $N$ has a prime factor $p$.

This prime $p$ must be one of $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ (since we assumed these are all the primes).

But $N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$And for each $p_i$:

$$N \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}$$

So $p_i \nmid N$ for all $i$. This contradicts that some $p_i$ divides $N$.

Therefore, there are infinitely many primes. $\blacksquare$

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
.../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic only Requires that $N$ has SOME prime factor not in the
list.
</aside>
### 3.3 $\log_2{3}$ is Irrational

**Theorem:** $\log_2{3}$ is irrational.

**Proof:**

We proceed by contradiction. Assume $\log_2{3}$ is rational.

Then $\log_2{3} = \frac{p}{q}$ for some coprime positive integers $p, q$ with $q \ge 1$.

This means $2^{p/q} = 3$So $2^p = 3^q$.

Since $p \ge 1$$2^p$ is a power of 2. Its only prime factor is 2.

Since $q \ge 1$$3^q$ is a power of 3. Its only prime factor is 3.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, prime factorizations are unique. The number $2^p = 3^q$
Would need to have prime factorization consisting of only 2's AND only 3's simultaneously. This is
Impossible unless $p = q = 0$But $p \ge 1$.

Contradiction. Hence $\log_2{3}$ is irrational. $\blacksquare$

<details>
<summary>Exercise: Prove that $\log_3{5}$ is irrational.</summary>

Assume $\log_3{5} = \frac{p}{q}$ in lowest terms, so $3^p = 5^q$. The LHS has only prime factor 3;
The RHS has only prime factor 5. By uniqueness of prime factorization, this is impossible unless
$p = q = 0$Contradicting $p \ge 1$. Hence $\log_3{5}$ is irrational.

</details>

### 3.4 Sum Formulas

We proved these by induction in Section 2.4. Here is the complete reference:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$$

The last identity is notable: the sum of cubes equals the square of the sum of the first $n$
Integers.

<details>
<summary>Exercise: Prove $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$ by induction.</summary>

Let $P(n)$: $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$.

Base case ($n = 1$): LHS $= 1$RHS $= \left(\frac{1 \cdot 2}{2}\right)^2 = 1$. True.

Inductive hypothesis: Assume $P(k)$ holds.

Inductive step:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i^3 = \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right)^2 + (k+1)^3$$

$$= \frac{k^2(k+1)^2}{4} + (k+1)^3 = (k+1)^2 \left(\frac{k^2}{4} + (k+1)\right)$$

$$= (k+1)^2 \cdot \frac{k^2 + 4k + 4}{4} = (k+1)^2 \cdot \frac{(k+2)^2}{4}$$

$$= \left(\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\right)^2$$

This is $P(k+1)$. By induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \ge 1$.

</details>

### 3.5 Divisibility Proofs

**Theorem:** If $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.

We proved this by contrapositive in Section 2.3. Here are additional divisibility results.

**Theorem:** If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$Then $a \mid c$ (transitivity of divisibility).

**Proof:**

Since $a \mid b$There exists $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $b = am$. Since $b \mid c$There exists
$n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $c = bn$.

Therefore $c = bn = (am)n = a(mn)$.

Since $mn \in \mathbb{Z}$We have $a \mid c$. $\blacksquare$

**Theorem:** If $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$Then $d \mid (ax + by)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$.

**Proof:**

Since $d \mid a$Write $a = dm$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$. Since $d \mid b$Write $b = dn$ for Some
$n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$ax + by = (dm)x + (dn)y = d(mx + ny)$.

Since $mx + ny \in \mathbb{Z}$$d \mid (ax + by)$. $\blacksquare$

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
Called a **linear combination** of $a$ and $b$. The greatest common divisor $\gcd(a, b)$ can always
Be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ (Bezout's identity).
</aside>
### 3.6 Inequality Proofs

**AM-GM Inequality (two variables):** For $a, b \ge 0$:

$$\frac{a + b}{2} \ge \sqrt{ab}$$

With equality if and only if $a = b$.

**Proof:**

Note that $(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})^2 \ge 0$ for all $a, b \ge 0$.

Expanding: $a - 2\sqrt{ab} + b \ge 0$So $a + b \ge 2\sqrt{ab}$.

Dividing by 2: $\frac{a+b}{2} \ge \sqrt{ab}$. Equality holds when $\sqrt{a} = \sqrt{b}$I.e.,
$a = b$. $\blacksquare$

**Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (statement):** For real numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and
$b_1, \ldots, b_n$:

$$\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i\right)^2 \le \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2\right) \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2\right)$$

With equality when the vectors are proportional ($a_i = \lambda b_i$ for all $i$ and some scalar
$\lambda$).

The .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic is beyond the scope of this note but uses the fact
that $\sum (a_i x + b_i)^2 \ge 0$ for All $x \in \mathbb{R}$And a quadratic in $x$ that is always
non-negative must have a non-positive Discriminant.

<details>
<summary>Exercise: Prove the AM-GM inequality for three variables: $\frac{a+b+c}{3} \ge \sqrt[3]{abc}$ for $a, b, c \ge 0$.</summary>

Apply two-variable AM-GM twice. First, $\frac{a+b}{2} \ge \sqrt{ab}$. Let $m = \frac{a+b}{2}$. Then:

$\frac{m + c}{2} \ge \sqrt{mc} \ge \sqrt{\sqrt{ab} \cdot c} = (abc)^{1/4}$

Wait, that gives us $\frac{\frac{a+b}{2} + c}{2} \ge (abc)^{1/4}$I.e.,
$\frac{a+b+2c}{4} \ge (abc)^{1/4}$.

That is not quite right for three-variable AM-GM. A cleaner approach: let $a = x^3$, $b = y^3$
$c = z^3$ with $x, y, z \ge 0$. We need $\frac{x^3 + y^3 + z^3}{3} \ge xyz$.

Consider $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = \frac{1}{2}(x+y+z)[(x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2] \ge 0$.

Since $x+y+z \ge 0$ and squares are non-negative, $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \ge 3xyz$. Dividing by 3 and
Substituting back gives the result.

## 4. Number Theory Proofs (HL Extension)

### 4.1 Divisibility Properties

For integers $a, b, c$ with $a \ne 0$:

**Definition:** $a \mid b$ (read "$a$ divides $b$") means there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
$b = ak$.

**Key properties:**

1. $a \mid 0$ for all $a \ne 0$ (since $0 = a \cdot 0$)
2. $1 \mid b$ for all $b$ (since $b = 1 \cdot b$)
3. If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$Then $a = \pm b$
4. If $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$Then $a \mid (b + c)$ and $a \mid (b - c)$

**Proof of property 3:**

$a \mid b$ implies $b = ma$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$. $b \mid a$ implies $a = nb$ for some
$n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Substituting: $a = n(ma) = (nm)a$So $(nm - 1)a = 0$. Since $a \ne 0$We have $nm = 1$.

In integers, $nm = 1$ implies $(n, m) = (1, 1)$ or $(n, m) = (-1, -1)$.

If $m = 1$: $b = a$. If $m = -1$: $b = -a$. So $a = \pm b$. $\blacksquare$

### 4.2 Congruences and Modular Arithmetic

**Definition:** $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ means $n \mid (a - b)$I.e., $a - b = kn$ for some
$k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

**Key properties of congruences:**

If $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ and $c \equiv d \pmod{n}$Then:

1. $a + c \equiv b + d \pmod{n}$
2. $a - c \equiv b - d \pmod{n}$
3. $ac \equiv bd \pmod{n}$
4. $a^m \equiv b^m \pmod{n}$ for any $m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$

**Proof of property 1:**

$a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ means $a - b = kn$. $c \equiv d \pmod{n}$ means $c - d = ln$.

$(a+c) - (b+d) = (a-b) + (c-d) = kn + ln = (k+l)n$.

Therefore $n \mid [(a+c) - (b+d)]$So $a+c \equiv b+d \pmod{n}$. $\blacksquare$

**Proof of property 3:**

$a = b + kn$ and $c = d + ln$ for some $k, l \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$ac = (b + kn)(d + ln) = bd + bln + dkn + kln^2 = bd + n(bl + dk + kln)$.

Therefore $n \mid (ac - bd)$So $ac \equiv bd \pmod{n}$. $\blacksquare$

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
conclude $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ if $\gcd(c, n) = 1$. For example, $6 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ and
$3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$But $\frac{6}{3} = 2 \not\equiv \frac{0}{0}$ (undefined).

<summary>Worked Example: Find the last two digits of $7^{100}$.</summary>

We need $7^{100} \pmod{100}$.

First, find $7^{100} \pmod{4}$: $7 \equiv 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4}$So
$7^{100} \equiv (-1)^{100} = 1 \pmod{4}$.

Next, find $7^{100} \pmod{25}$: By Euler's theorem (or Fermat's Little Theorem since 25 is a prime
Power and $\gcd(7, 25) = 1$), $\phi(25) = 20$So $7^{20} \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$Hence
$7^{100} = (7^{20})^5 \equiv 1^5 = 1 \pmod{25}$.

We need $x$ such that $x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and $x \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$. By CRT,
$x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$.

The last two digits are 01.

</details>

### 4.3 Fermat's Little Theorem

**Theorem (Fermat's Little Theorem):** If $p$ is prime and $\gcd(a, p) = 1$Then:

$$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$

Equivalently, for any integer $a$ and prime $p$: $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$.

**Proof sketch (using the fact that $\{a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (p-1)a\}$ is a permutation of
$\{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}$ modulo $p$):**

Consider the product $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (p-1) = (p-1)!$.

Modulo $p$The numbers $a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (p-1)a$ are all nonzero and pairwise non-congruent Modulo
$p$ (since $ja \equiv ka \pmod{p}$ implies $p \mid (j-k)a$And since $p \nmid a$We get
$p \mid (j-k)$Which means $j \equiv k \pmod{p}$And since $1 \le j, k \le p-1$We get $j = k$).

Therefore $\{a, 2a, \ldots, (p-1)a\}$ is a complete residue system modulo $p$ excluding 0, so:

$$a \cdot 2a \cdot 3a \cdots (p-1)a \equiv (p-1)! \pmod{p}$$

$$a^{p-1} \cdot (p-1)! \equiv (p-1)! \pmod{p}$$

Since $p \nmid (p-1)!$ (Wilson's theorem tells us $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$), we can divide both
Sides by $(p-1)!$ modulo $p$:

$$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \quad \blacksquare$$

**Worked Example — Find $2^{100} \pmod{13}$:**

Since 13 is prime and $\gcd(2, 13) = 1$By Fermat: $2^{12} \equiv 1 \pmod{13}$.

$100 = 8 \cdot 12 + 4$So
$2^{100} = (2^{12})^8 \cdot 2^4 \equiv 1^8 \cdot 16 \equiv 16 \equiv 3 \pmod{13}$.

<details>
<summary>Exercise: Find $3^{50} \pmod{11}$.</summary>

By Fermat: $3^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.

$50 = 5 \cdot 10$So $3^{50} = (3^{10})^5 \equiv 1^5 = 1 \pmod{11}$.

Answer: $3^{50} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.

</details>

### 4.4 Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

**Theorem:** Every integer $n \ge 2$ can be expressed uniquely (up to order of factors) as a product
Of primes:

$$n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}$$

Where $p_1 \lt p_2 \lt \cdots \lt p_k$ are primes and $a_i \ge 1$.

**Existence** was proved in Section 2.4.2 using strong induction. Here we sketch **uniqueness**.

**Uniqueness .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic (sketch):**

Suppose $n$ has two prime factorizations:

$$n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s$$

Where all $p_i, q_j$ are primes. Since $p_1 \mid n = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s$By Euclid's lemma
($p \mid ab$ and $p$ prime implies $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$), $p_1$ divides some $q_j$.

Since $q_j$ is prime and $p_1$ is prime with $p_1 \mid q_j$We must have $p_1 = q_j$. Cancel this
Factor and repeat. By induction, the factorizations are identical. $\blacksquare$

### 4.5 GCD and LCM Properties

**Definition:** $\gcd(a, b)$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ — the largest positive
Integer dividing both.

**Definition:** $\mathrm{lcm}(a, b)$ is the least common multiple — the smallest positive integer
That both $a$ and $b$ divide.

**Key relationship:**

$$\gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathrm{lcm}(a, b) = |ab|$$

**Proof (using prime factorizations):**

Let $a = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i}$ and $b = \prod p_i^{\beta_i}$ (with $\alpha_i, \beta_i \ge 0$ Padding
with zeros where needed).

$\gcd(a, b) = \prod p_i^{\min(\alpha_i, \beta_i)}$

$\mathrm{lcm}(a, b) = \prod p_i^{\max(\alpha_i, \beta_i)}$

$\gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathrm{lcm}(a,b) = \prod p_i^{\min(\alpha_i, \beta_i) + \max(\alpha_i, \beta_i)} = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i + \beta_i} = ab$.
$\blacksquare$

**Bezout's Identity:** For integers $a, b$ (not both zero), there exist integers $x, y$ such that:

$$\gcd(a, b) = ax + by$$

This is proved constructively by the Euclidean algorithm (reversing the steps).

### 4.6 Euclidean Algorithm Correctness

**Theorem:** The Euclidean algorithm correctly computes $\gcd(a, b)$.

**Algorithm:** For $a \ge b \ge 0$:

$$a = bq_1 + r_1, \quad 0 \le r_1 \lt b$$ $$b = r_1 q_2 + r_2, \quad 0 \le r_2 \lt r_1$$
$$r_1 = r_2 q_3 + r_3, \quad 0 \le r_3 \lt r_2$$

$$\vdots$$

$$r_{n-2} = r_{n-1} q_n + r_n, \quad 0 \le r_n \lt r_{n-1}$$ $$r_{n-1} = r_n q_{n+1} + 0$$

The algorithm terminates with $\gcd(a, b) = r_n$.

**Proof of correctness:**

**Claim 1:** The remainders form a strictly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers:
$b \gt r_1 \gt r_2 \gt \cdots \ge 0$. This follows from the division algorithm: each remainder is
Strictly less than the previous divisor.

**Claim 2:** The algorithm terminates. Since the remainders are non-negative integers and strictly
Decrease, the process must eventually reach remainder 0 (by the well-ordering principle).

**Claim 3:** $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r_1) = \gcd(r_1, r_2) = \cdots = \gcd(r_{n-1}, r_n)$. This
Follows from the key lemma: $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - bq)$ for any integer $q$.

Proof of the key lemma: if $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$Then $d \mid (a - bq)$. Conversely, if
$d \mid b$ and $d \mid (a - bq)$Then $d \mid (a - bq + bq) = a$. So $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$ If
and only if $d$ divides both $b$ and $a - bq$. Therefore $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - bq)$.

**Claim 4:** $\gcd(r_{n-1}, r_n) = r_n$. Since $r_n \mid r_{n-1}$ (the last step is
$r_{n-1} = r_n q_{n+1}$), the GCD is $r_n$.

Combining claims: $\gcd(a, b) = r_n$. $\blacksquare$

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Compute $\gcd(252, 105)$ and express it as a linear combination.</summary>

$252 = 105 \cdot 2 + 42$ $105 = 42 \cdot 2 + 21$ $42 = 21 \cdot 2 + 0$

So $\gcd(252, 105) = 21$.

Back-substitution to find Bezout coefficients:

$21 = 105 - 42 \cdot 2$

$42 = 252 - 105 \cdot 2$

$21 = 105 - (252 - 105 \cdot 2) \cdot 2 = 105 - 252 \cdot 2 + 105 \cdot 4 = 105 \cdot 5 - 252 \cdot 2$

So $\gcd(252, 105) = 21 = 5 \cdot 105 + (-2) \cdot 252$.

## 5. Common Pitfalls

### 5.1 Circular Reasoning

Circular reasoning occurs when you implicitly assume what you are trying to prove.

**Example of circular reasoning:**

"Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational."

Bad .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic: "Since $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, it cannot be
written as $\frac{a}{b}$. Therefore $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational."

The conclusion ($\sqrt{2}$ is irrational) appears in the hypothesis. This proves nothing.

**How to avoid:** Check that every step of your .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic relies
only on axioms, definitions, and Previously established theorems — never on the statement you are
proving.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--danger">
Look convincing. Always verify that your .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic does not contain
the conclusion as an unstated Assumption.
</aside>
### 5.2 Assuming the Conclusion

Related to circular reasoning, this occurs when you "work backwards" from the conclusion without
Checking reversibility.

**Example:**

"Prove: If $x^2 = 4$Then $x = 2$."

Bad .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic: $x^2 = 4$So $x = \sqrt{4} = 2$. Done.

This is wrong because $x = -2$ also satisfies $x^2 = 4$. The step $x = \sqrt{4}$ implicitly assumes
$x \ge 0$.

The statement itself is false: $x^2 = 4$ does not imply $x = 2$. The correct implication is
$x^2 = 4 \implies x = 2$ or $x = -2$.

### 5.3 Incorrect Negation of Implications

The negation of $P \implies Q$ is NOT $P \implies \neg Q$.

$$\neg(P \implies Q) \equiv P \wedge \neg Q$$

**Reasoning:** $P \implies Q$ is logically equivalent to $\neg P \vee Q$ (check the truth table).
So:

$$\neg(P \implies Q) \equiv \neg(\neg P \vee Q) \equiv P \wedge \neg Q$$

**Worked Example:**

Negate: "If it rains, the ground gets wet."

Correct negation: "It rains AND the ground does NOT get wet." (The premise holds but the conclusion
Fails.)

Incorrect negation: "If it rains, the ground does not get wet." (This is a different implication
Entirely.)

Memorize: the negation of "$P$ implies</p>
$Q$" is "$P$ AND not $Q$."
</aside>
### 5.4 Induction Base Case Errors

**The pitfall:** Skipping the base case or proving the wrong base case.

**Example:**

"Prove: $n = n + 1$ for all $n \ge 1$."

Bad .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic: Assume $k = k + 1$. Then
$k + 1 = (k + 1) + 1 = k + 2$. So $k + 1 = k + 2$I.e., $k + 1 = (k+1) + 1$. QED.

This ".../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic" never checks the base case. The statement
$1 = 1 + 1 = 2$ is false, so the base case Fails.

**Another example:** When using strong induction with a recursive definition like the Fibonacci
Sequence, you may need MULTIPLE base cases. Proving the induction step from $P(k)$ and $P(k-1)$ to
$P(k+1)$ requires both $P(1)$ and $P(2)$ as base cases.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Prove $F_n \le 2^n$ for all $n \ge 1$Where $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number.</summary>

Let $P(n)$: $F_n \le 2^n$.

Base cases: $F_1 = 1 \le 2 = 2^1$. True. $F_2 = 1 \le 4 = 2^2$. True. We need TWO base cases because
The recurrence $F_{k+1} = F_k + F_{k-1}$ references two previous terms.

Strong inductive hypothesis: Assume $F_j \le 2^j$ for all $1 \le j \le k$Where $k \ge 2$.

Inductive step:

$F_{k+1} = F_k + F_{k-1} \le 2^k + 2^{k-1} = 2^{k-1}(2 + 1) = 3 \cdot 2^{k-1}$

Now, $3 \cdot 2^{k-1} \le 4 \cdot 2^{k-1} = 2^{k+1}$ since $3 \le 4$.

Therefore $F_{k+1} \le 2^{k+1}$. By strong induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \ge 1$.

If we had only checked $P(1)$ and tried to use weak induction, the inductive step from $P(k)$ alone
Would not suffice because $F_{k+1}$ depends on $F_{k-1}$ as well.

</details>

### 5.5 Weak vs. Strong Induction Confusion

**Weak induction** assumes $P(k)$ and proves $P(k+1)$.

**Strong induction** assumes $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(k)$ and proves $P(k+1)$.

**Common mistake:** Using weak induction when you need strong induction. If $P(k+1)$ depends on
$P(k-1)$ or earlier, weak induction's hypothesis is insufficient.

**Common mistake (reverse):** Always using strong induction "to be safe." While not logically wrong,
This is unnecessary and makes .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logics harder to read. Use weak
induction unless the structure Of the problem requires strong induction.

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--tip">
$n! = n \cdot (n-1)!$), use weak induction. If on earlier terms (like $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$),
use strong induction.
</aside>
### 5.6 Confusing Converse with Contrapositive

| Original                    | $P \implies Q$           |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Contrapositive (equivalent) | $\neg Q \implies \neg P$ |
| Converse (NOT equivalent)   | $Q \implies P$           |
| Inverse (NOT equivalent)    | $\neg P \implies \neg Q$ |

A true implication does NOT guarantee a true converse.

**Example:** "If a number is prime, then it is positive." True (for integers). Converse: "If a
Number is positive, then it is prime." False ($4$ is positive but not prime).

### 5.7 Forgetting Vacuous Truth

The implication $P \implies Q$ is true whenever $P$ is false, regardless of $Q$.

**Example:** "If $1 = 0$Then the moon is made of cheese." This is TRUE (vacuously), because the
Premise "$1 = 0$" is false.

**Practical consequence:** To disprove $P \implies Q$You must show $P$ is true AND $Q$ is false.
Showing $P$ is false does NOT disprove the implication.

### 5.8 Incorrect Quantifier Negation

| Statement                            | Correct Negation                          |
| :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| $\forall x, \; P(x)$                 | $\exists x, \; \neg P(x)$                 |
| $\exists x, \; P(x)$                 | $\forall x, \; \neg P(x)$                 |
| $\forall x, \; \exists y, \; P(x,y)$ | $\exists x, \; \forall y, \; \neg P(x,y)$ |
| $\exists x, \; \forall y, \; P(x,y)$ | $\forall x, \; \exists y, \; \neg P(x,y)$ |

<aside aria-label="The order of quantifiers matters. "For every person, there exists a mother" is very" class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--danger"><p class="starlight-aside__title" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="starlight-aside__icon" aria-hidden="true" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor"><path d="M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.48 10 10 10 10-4.48 10-10S17.52 2 12 2Zm1 15h-2v-2h2v2Zm0-4h-2V7h2v6Z"/></svg>The order of quantifiers matters. "For every person, there exists a mother" is very</p>
Different from "There exists a person who is the mother of everyone." The negation of "for every x
There exists y" is "there exists x such that for every y" — quantifiers flip but their order is
Preserved.

<summary>Answers to Selected Exercises</summary>

**Exercise 1:** Assume $\sqrt{6} = \frac{a}{b}$ in lowest terms. Then $a^2 = 6b^2$So $a^2$ is even
(divisible by 2), hence $a$ is even. Write $a = 2k$. Then $4k^2 = 6b^2$So $2k^2 = 3b^2$. This Means
$3b^2$ is even, so $b^2$ is even, so $b$ is even. Both $a$ and $b$ are even, contradicting Lowest
terms.

**Exercise 2:** Among any three consecutive integers $n, n+1, n+2$: one is divisible by 3 (since one
Of $n, n+1, n+2$ is a multiple of 3), and at least one is even (among any two consecutive integers,
One is even, and we have three). Since 2 and 3 are coprime, the product is divisible by
$2 \cdot 3 = 6$.

**Exercise 4:** By contrapositive. If $3 \nmid n$Then $n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ or
$n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$. If $n \equiv 1$Then $n^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. If $n \equiv 2$Then
$n^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. In either case $n^2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}$So $3 \nmid n^2$.

**Exercise 5:** Counterexample: $x = 0.5$. Then $x^2 = 0.25 \not\gt 0.5$. Also $x = 0$:
$0^2 = 0 \not\gt 0$.

**Exercise 6:** $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}, \; \forall y \in \mathbb{R}, \; x + y \ne 0$.

**Exercise 10:** $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ means $m \mid (a-b)$. Since $n \mid m$ and $m \mid (a-b)$By
Transitivity of divisibility, $n \mid (a-b)$. Therefore $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$.

**Example 1: Logarithm laws**

Solve $\log_3(x + 1) + \log_3(x - 1) = 2$.

**Solution:**

$$\log_3[(x+1)(x-1)] = 2$$

$$(x+1)(x-1) = 3^2 = 9$$

$$x^2 - 1 = 9 \implies x^2 = 10 \implies x = \sqrt{10}$$ (since $x > 1$)
