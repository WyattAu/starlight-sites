# The Logic Of Arguments

## Arg1: Simple Logic

- In mathematics, statements must be true or false.
- A statement is a sentence which is definitely true or definitely false. A statement can never be
  both true and false.
- Examples:
- "If $x = 3$Then $x^2 = 9$." This is certainly true, so it is a statement.
- "If $x = 3$Then $x^2 = 4$." This is certainly false, so it is a statement.
- "The sum of two odd numbers is an even number." This is certainly true, so it is a statement.

### Truth values

A truth value is whether the statement is true or false. For instance:

- Truth value of the statement "2 is an even number" is "true"
- Truth value of the statement "2 is an odd number" is "false".

### Logically equivalent

Two statements being logically equivalent means that they have the same truth values in the same
Circumstances. For example:

- Today is Tuesday; True
- Today is the day after Monday; Also True.

### Making new statements

- 21 is divisible by 3 and 21 is divisible by 6 \[A and B]
- 21 is divisible by 3 or 21 is divisible by 6 \[A or B]
- 21 is not divisible by 6 \[not B]
- if 21 is divisible by 3 then 21 is divisible by 6 \[if A then B]
- 21 is divisible by 3 if 21 is divisible by 6 \[A if B]
- 21 is divisible by 3 only if 21 is divisible by 6 \[A only if B]
- 21 is divisible by 3 if and only if 21 is divisible by 6 \[A if and only if B]

### The term "not"

Negates a statement. Only applies to what occurs immediately after unless there are brackets.
Therefore, we can say not A or B is the same as (not A) or B.

### If, only if, if and only if

I cry if I am sad

- $\mathrm{Sad}\implies\mathrm{Cry}$
- Means that if I am sad, then I cry.
- It doesn"t say that there aren't other situations in which I might also cry.
- I can cry under other conditions. Being sad is NOT the only condition.
- Leads to the 'if... Then...' statement: If I am sad, then I am crying.

I cry only if I am sad

- $\mathrm{Cry}\implies\mathrm{Sad}$
- If I am crying, then I am sad. This is because only under this condition (being sad) I can cry.
- This does not mean that I cry every time I am sad. I can be sad and not cry, but if I am crying,
  then I HAVE to be sad.
- Being sad is the only thing that can cause me to cry.
- Leads to the 'if... Then...' statement: If I am crying, then I am sad.

I cry if and only if I am sad

- $\mathrm{Sad}\iff\mathrm{Cry}$
- Combination of the other two statements, both must be true.
- I cry if I am sad: "If I am sad then I cry''
- I cry only if I am sad: "If I am crying then I am sad'
- The only time I ever cry is if I am sad, and I will 100% cry if I am sad.

The church bells ring if it is Sunday

- $\mathrm{Sunday}\implies\mathrm{Ring}$
- If it is Sunday, then the bells ring
- On Sunday, at some point the bells ring
- Doesn't say anything else about the other days
- Example: A church that rings the bells at midday every day

The church bells ring only if it is Sunday

- $\mathrm{Ring}\implies\mathrm{Sunday}$
- If the bells ring, then it is Sunday
- The bells will not ring on any other day
- They might not ring on Sunday/on every Sunday
- Example: A church that rings only once a year on remembrance Sunday

The church bells ring if and only if it is Sunday

- Both 'if... Then...' statements are true
- On Sunday you will hear the bells ring, and you will not hear the bells ring on any other day.

A number is prime if it is an integer

- $\mathrm{Integer}\implies\mathrm{Prime}$ : False, lots of integers are not prime.
- If a number is an integer, then it is prime.
- It can also possible be a decimal and prime, doesn't have to be an integer

A number is prime only if it is an integer

- $\mathrm{Prime}\implies\mathrm{Integer}$ : True, all primes are integers.
- If a number is prime, then it is an integer.

A number is prime if and only if it is an integer

- $\mathrm{Integer}\iff\mathrm{Prime}$ : False, all primes are integers, but not all integers are
  primes
- Both statements must be true.

A shape is a rectangle if it is a square

- $\mathrm{Square}\implies\mathrm{Rectangle}$ : True, all squares are rectangles
- If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle

A shape is a rectangle only if it is a square

- $\mathrm{Rectangle}\implies\mathrm{Square}$ : False, not all rectangles are squares
- If a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.

A shape is a rectangle if and only if it is a square

- $\mathrm{Square}\iff\mathrm{Rectangle}$ : False, because one of the two statements above are
  false.

A if B

- Same as: If B, then A
- Therefore B is sufficient for A
- $B\implies A$

A only if B

- Same as: If A then B
- Therefore B is necessary for A
- $A\implies B$

A if and only if B

- Same as: If A then B and If B then A
- B is necessary and sufficient for A
- $A\iff B$

### Negation of Statements

Statement: That man is tall Negation: That man is not tall Wrong: That man is short

Rule 1: Just add not Rule 2: Don't say the opposite

Statement: All the students are short Negation: At least one student is not short

Rule 3: Don't claim too much

Statement: None of the teachers are interesting Equivalent to: All of the teachers are not
Interesting Negation: Some of the teachers are interesting At least one teacher is interesting

Statement: All A are B Negation: Some A are not B At least one A is not B

Statement: No A are B Negation: Some A are B At least one A is B

Statement: Some of the topics are hard Negation: All of the topics are not hard None of the topics
Are hard

Statement: All numbers are prime Negation: Some numbers are not prime

Statement: Some shapes have 4 sides Negation: No shapes have 4 sides

Statement: No integers are factors of 20 Negation: Some integers are factors of 20

Statement: Every day next week, Fred will do at least one maths problem All days, Fred don math
Negation: Some day next week, Fred will do no maths problems. Some days, Fred not do math

### Converse

Basically opposite of a statement. Swap A and B.

| Statement   | Converse    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| if A then B | if B then A |
| A only if B | B only if A |
| A if B      | B if A      |
| A iff B     | B iff A     |

### Contrapositive

Basically the equivalent of a statement. Swap A and B, then negate both of them

| Statement   | Contrapositive      |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| if A then B | if not B then not A |
| A only if B | not B only if not A |
| A if B      | not B if not A      |
| A iff B     | not B iff not A     |

## Truth Tables

### Basic connectives

A **truth table** lists all possible truth values of a compound statement in terms of its component
Statements. For a statement depending on $n$ propositions, the table has $2^n$ rows.

**Negation (NOT):** $\neg P$ is true exactly when $P$ is false.

| $P$ | $\neg P$ |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |

**Conjunction (AND):** $P \land Q$ is true only when both $P$ and $Q$ are true.

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \land Q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| T   | T   | T           |
| T   | F   | F           |
| F   | T   | F           |
| F   | F   | F           |

**Disjunction (OR, inclusive):** $P \lor Q$ is false only when both $P$ and $Q$ are false.

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \lor Q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| T   | T   | T          |
| T   | F   | T          |
| F   | T   | T          |
| F   | F   | F          |

### The implication $P \Rightarrow Q$

The truth table for implication is often the least intuitive:

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \Rightarrow Q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------------- |
| T   | T   | T                 |
| T   | F   | F                 |
| F   | T   | T                 |
| F   | F   | T                 |

An implication is **false only when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false**. This
Captures the logical reading: if you promise "if $P$ then $Q$", you have only broken your promise
When $P$ happens and $Q$ does not.

The last two rows often feel surprising. Consider the statement "If it is raining, then I carry an
Umbrella." If it is not raining (rows 3 and 4), the statement places no restriction on my behaviour
-- it remains true regardless of whether I carry an umbrella.

### Contrapositive has the same truth table

The contrapositive of $P \Rightarrow Q$ is $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$. Constructing the truth
Table:

| $P$ | $Q$ | $\neg P$ | $\neg Q$ | $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| T   | T   | F        | F        | T                           |
| T   | F   | F        | T        | F                           |
| F   | T   | T        | F        | T                           |
| F   | F   | T        | T        | T                           |

The column for $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$ is identical to the column for $P \Rightarrow Q$ (T, F,
T, T). This is why a statement and its contrapositive are **logically equivalent**: proving one
Proves the other.

### The converse does NOT have the same truth table

The converse of $P \Rightarrow Q$ is $Q \Rightarrow P$:

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \Rightarrow Q$ | $Q \Rightarrow P$ |
| --- | --- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| T   | T   | T                 | T                 |
| T   | F   | F                 | T                 |
| F   | T   | T                 | F                 |
| F   | F   | T                 | T                 |

The truth values differ in rows 2 and 3. This is why the converse of a true statement need not be
True. For instance, "If a number is prime then it is odd" ($P = \mathrm{prime}$, $Q = \mathrm{odd}$)
Is false (witness $2$), but its converse "If a number is odd then it is prime" is also false
(witness $9$). In contrast, "If a number is a square then it is a rectangle" is true, but its
Converse "If a number is a rectangle then it is a square" is false.

## Quantifiers

### Universal and existential quantifiers

Many mathematical statements involve quantifiers, which specify the scope over which a statement
Applies.

- The **universal quantifier** "for all" (symbol $\forall$) asserts that a property holds for every
  element in a set.
- Example: "For all integers $n$, $n + 0 = n$."
- In symbols: $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z},\; n + 0 = n$.

- The **existential quantifier** "there exists" (symbol $\exists$) asserts that a property holds for
  at least one element in a set.
- Example: "There exists an integer $n$ such that $n^2 = 4$."
- In symbols: $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z},\; n^2 = 4$.

A useful mnemonic: $\forall$ is an **upside-down A** (for "All"); $\exists$ is a **backwards E**
(for "Exists").

### Negating quantified statements

Negation flips the quantifier and negates the predicate:

- $\neg(\forall x,\; P(x)) \equiv \exists x,\; \neg P(x)$

"Not (for all $x$, $P(x)$ holds)" means "there exists some $x$ for which $P(x)$ does not hold."

- $\neg(\exists x,\; P(x)) \equiv \forall x,\; \neg P(x)$

"Not (there exists an $x$ such that $P(x)$ holds)" means "for every $x$, $P(x)$ does not hold."

This matches the informal rules from the Negation section:

| Original                          | Negation         |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| All A are B                       | Some A are not B |
| No A are B (i.e. All A are not B) | Some A are B     |
| Some A are B                      | No A are B       |

### Worked examples

**Example 1.** Negate: "For all real numbers $x$, $x^2 \ge 0$."

Negation: "There exists a real number $x$ such that $x^2 \lt 0$."

(As it happens, the original statement is true and its negation is false.)

**Example 2.** Negate: "There exists an integer $n$ such that $n^2 + 1 = 0$."

Negation: "For all integers $n$, $n^2 + 1 \neq 0$."

**Example 3.** Negate: "For every integer $n$If $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even."

Negation: "There exists an integer $n$ such that $n$ is even and $n^2$ is not even."

Notice that negating an implication $P \Rightarrow Q$ produces $\neg Q$ alongside $P$: the negation
Is "$P$ and not $Q$", not "$P \Rightarrow \neg Q$". This is because $P \Rightarrow Q$ is logically
Equivalent to $\neg P \lor Q$And negating gives $P \land \neg Q$.

**Example 4.** Negate: "For all real numbers $x$ there exists a real number $y$ such that
$x + y = 0$."

Negation: "There exists a real number $x$ such that for all real numbers $y$, $x + y \neq 0$."

When negating a chain of quantifiers, the order reverses. The rightmost quantifier flips first, then
The next, and so on -- just like removing nested negations.

## Necessary and Sufficient Conditions: Formal Definitions

## Arg2: Necessary and Sufficient

The informal airport and twin examples give the right intuition. Here is the formal framework.

### Definitions

- $A$ is **sufficient** for $B$ means $A \Rightarrow B$. Establishing $A$ is enough to guarantee
  $B$; no further conditions are needed.

- $A$ is **necessary** for $B$ means $B \Rightarrow A$. Whenever $B$ holds, $A$ must hold; $B$
  cannot be true without $A$.

- $A$ is **necessary and sufficient** for $B$ means $A \Leftrightarrow B$. $A$ and $B$ are logically
  equivalent; they stand or fall together.

### Table of examples

| Condition $A$             | Condition $B$             | Relationship           | Why                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| $n$ is even               | $n^2$ is even             | $A$ sufficient for $B$ | If $n = 2k$ then $n^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$              |
| $n^2$ is even             | $n$ is even               | $A$ necessary for $B$  | If $n$ were odd, $n^2$ would be odd (contrapositive) |
| $x \lt 10$                | $x \lt 20$                | $A$ sufficient for $B$ | Every number below 10 is below 20                    |
| $x \lt 20$                | $x \lt 10$                | $A$ necessary for $B$  | Not every number below 20 is below 10                |
| $n$ is prime              | $n$ is a positive integer | $A$ sufficient for $B$ | All primes are positive integers                     |
| $n$ is a positive integer | $n$ is prime              | neither                | 4 is positive but not prime; 2 is prime              |
| $n$ is divisible by 6     | $n$ is divisible by 2     | $A$ sufficient for $B$ | $6 \mid n \Rightarrow 2 \mid n$                      |
| $n$ is divisible by 2     | $n$ is divisible by 6     | $A$ necessary for $B$  | $6 \mid n \Rightarrow 2 \mid n$                      |
| $x = y$                   | $x^2 = y^2$               | $A$ sufficient for $B$ | Squaring preserves equality                          |
| $x^2 = y^2$               | $x = y$                   | neither                | $(-1)^2 = 1^2$ but $-1 \neq 1$                       |

### Connecting to if/only if

The relationship between "if", "only if", and necessary/sufficient is:

- "$A$ if $B$" means $B$ is sufficient for $A$ (i.e. $B \Rightarrow A$).
- "$A$ only if $B$" means $B$ is necessary for $A$ (i.e. $A \Rightarrow B$).
- "$A$ if and only if $B$" means $B$ is necessary and sufficient for $A$ (i.e.
  $A \Leftrightarrow B$).

### A useful rephrasing

When asked "Is $A$ necessary/sufficient for $B$?", you can reframe the question:

- Is $A$ sufficient for $B$? $\longleftrightarrow$ Is $A \Rightarrow B$ a true statement?
- Is $A$ necessary for $B$? $\longleftrightarrow$ Is $B \Rightarrow A$ a true statement?

Answering these reduces to constructing a .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic or finding a
counterexample.

## Proof Techniques

## Prf1: Types of Proof

### Direct .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic

**Structure.** To prove $P \Rightarrow Q$ directly, assume $P$ is true and deduce $Q$ through a
Chain of valid deductions.

$$P \Rightarrow S_1 \Rightarrow S_2 \Rightarrow \cdots \Rightarrow Q$$

**Worked example.** Prove that the sum of two even integers is even.

**Proof.** Let $a$ and $b$ be even integers. By definition of evenness, there exist integers $k$ and
$m$ such that $a = 2k$ and $b = 2m$. Then

$$a + b = 2k + 2m = 2(k + m)$$

Since $k + m$ is an integer (the integers are closed under addition), $a + b$ is divisible by 2, and
Therefore $a + b$ is even. $\square$

**Remark.** The key move was substituting the definition of evenness ($a = 2k$), performing algebra,
And then reversing the definition. This pattern -- unpack a definition, manipulate, repack -- is the
Backbone of most direct .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logics.

### Proof by contradiction

**Structure.** To prove a statement $P$Assume $\neg P$ is true and deduce a contradiction (something
that is always false, such as $0 = 1$ or $q^2 = 2$ where $q$ is rational). Since the Assumption
$\neg P$ led to an impossibility, $\neg P$ must be false, so $P$ is true.

$$\neg P \Rightarrow \cdots \Rightarrow \mathrm{contradiction} \quad \therefore P$$

**Worked example 1.** Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

**Proof.** Suppose, for contradiction, that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$
For some coprime integers $a$ and $b$ (i.e. $\gcd(a, b) = 1$), with $b \neq 0$. Squaring both sides:

$$2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = 2b^2$$

This means $a^2$ is even. Since the square of an odd number is odd, $a$ must be even. Write $a = 2k$
For some integer $k$. Substituting:

$$(2k)^2 = 2b^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4k^2 = 2b^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b^2 = 2k^2$$

So $b^2$ is even, and therefore $b$ is even. But now both $a$ and $b$ are even, contradicting
$\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Hence $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. $\square$

**Worked example 2.** Prove that there are infinitely many primes.

**Proof.** Suppose, for contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes. List them as
$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. Consider the number

$$N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$$

When $N$ is divided by any $p_i$The remainder is 1 (since each $p_i$ divides the product
$p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n$ but not the added 1). Therefore no $p_i$ divides $N$. Since every integer
Greater than 1 has a prime factor, $N$ must have a prime factor not in our list -- a contradiction.
Hence there are infinitely many primes. $\square$

### Proof by contrapositive

**Structure.** To prove $P \Rightarrow Q$Instead prove the logically equivalent contrapositive
$\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$.

$$\neg Q \Rightarrow \cdots \Rightarrow \neg P$$

This is useful when the negation of the conclusion gives you more to work with than the hypothesis
Does.

**Worked example.** Prove that if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.

Rather than working from "$n^2$ is even" to "$n$ is even" directly, we prove the contrapositive: if
$n$ is not even (i.e. $n$ is odd), then $n^2$ is not even (i.e. $n^2$ is odd).

**Proof.** Let $n$ be an odd integer. Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Computing:

$$n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$$

Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is an integer, $n^2$ is of the form $2m + 1$Which means $n^2$ is odd. We have
Shown: if $n$ is odd then $n^2$ is odd. By contrapositive, if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even.
$\square$

### Proof by cases

**Structure.** Split the domain into exhaustive, mutually exclusive cases and prove the result holds
In each one.

$$\mathrm{Case 1: } C_1 \Rightarrow Q \qquad \mathrm{Case 2: } C_2 \Rightarrow Q \qquad \cdots$$

Since the cases cover all possibilities, $Q$ holds unconditionally.

**Worked example.** Prove that $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

**Proof.** We consider four cases based on the signs of $x$ and $y$. In each case $a$ and $b$ denote
Non-negative reals.

| Case | $x$  | $y$  | $xy$  | $    | xy               | $   | $   | x   | \,  | y   | $   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1    | $a$  | $b$  | $ab$  | $ab$ | $a \cdot b = ab$ |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 2    | $a$  | $-b$ | $-ab$ | $ab$ | $a \cdot b = ab$ |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 3    | $-a$ | $b$  | $-ab$ | $ab$ | $a \cdot b = ab$ |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 4    | $-a$ | $-b$ | $ab$  | $ab$ | $a \cdot b = ab$ |     |     |     |     |     |     |

In all four cases $|xy| = |x|\,|y|$. $\square$

### Dis.../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic by counterexample

**Structure.** To disprove a universal claim $\forall x,\; P(x)$It suffices to produce a single
$x_0$ for which $P(x_0)$ is false. This is the negation of a universal statement:
$\exists x,\; \neg P(x)$.

**Worked example 1.** Disprove: "All prime numbers are odd."

Counterexample: $2$ is prime and $2$ is even.

**Worked example 2.** Disprove: "For all real numbers $x$, $x^2 \gt x$."

Counterexample: $x = 0.5$ gives $x^2 = 0.25 \lt 0.5 = x$.

**Worked example 3.** Disprove: "If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, then
$a^2 + b^2 \ge 2ab + 1$."

Counterexample: $a = 1$, $b = 1$ gives $1 + 1 = 2$ but $2(1)(1) + 1 = 3$And $2 \lt 3$.

### Common errors in .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logics (Err1, Err2)

Several tempting deductions are invalid. The TMUA specification specifically highlights two:

**Error 1:** "If $ab = ac$Then $b = c$."

This implicitly assumes $a \neq 0$. Counterexample: $a = 0$, $b = 3$, $c = 7$. Then
$0 \cdot 3 = 0 \cdot 7 = 0$But $3 \neq 7$. The correct deduction is: if $ab = ac$ and $a \neq 0$
Then $b = c$.

**Error 2:** "If $\sin A = \sin B$Then $A = B$."

Counterexample: $\sin 30^{\circ} = \sin 150^{\circ} = 0.5$But $30^{\circ} \neq 150^\circ$. The
correct statement is: if $\sin A = \sin B$ and $A, B \in [-90^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$Then $A = B$. ,
$\sin A = \sin B$ implies $A = B + 360^{\circ}k$ or $A = 180^{\circ} - B + 360^{\circ}k$ for some
integer $k$.

**Other common errors:**

- **Affirming the consequent:** From $P \Rightarrow Q$ and $Q$Deducing $P$. This is the fallacy of
  treating the converse as equivalent to the original. Example: "All primes greater than 2 are odd.
  9 is odd. Therefore 9 is prime." -- Invalid.

- **Denying the antecedent:** From $P \Rightarrow Q$ and $\neg P$Deducing $\neg Q$. Example: "If it
  is a square, then it is a rectangle. This shape is not a square. Therefore it is not a rectangle."
  -- Invalid (it could be a non-square rectangle).

- **Dividing by a variable without checking it is non-zero.** This is the root cause of Error 1
  above.

- **Assuming what you are trying to prove** (circular reasoning / begging the question). Every step
  in a .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic must follow from definitions, axioms, or
  previously established results -- not from the statement being proved.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing necessary and sufficient

"$A$ is necessary for $B$" means $B \Rightarrow A$Not $A \Rightarrow B$. Students frequently swap
These. Remember: a necessary condition is one you **cannot do without**; a sufficient condition is
One that is **enough on its own**.

A reliable test: ask yourself "Is condition $A$ enough to guarantee $B$?" If yes, $A$ is sufficient.
Ask "Must $A$ hold whenever $B$ holds?" If yes, $A$ is necessary.

### Pitfall 2: Negating an implication incorrectly

The negation of "$P \Rightarrow Q$" is **not** "$P \Rightarrow \neg Q$". It is "$P$ and $\neg Q$". :
to show that "if $P$ then $Q$" is false, you must exhibit a case where $P$ is true but $Q$ is false.

### Pitfall 3: Forgetting that "or" is inclusive

In mathematics, "or" means **at least one** holds, possibly both. "A or B" is false only when both
Are false. This differs from everyday English, where "or" is sometimes exclusive (e.g. "tea or
Coffee").

### Pitfall 4: Treating the converse as equivalent

A statement and its converse have different truth values (see the truth table section). Proving
$P \Rightarrow Q$ does **not** prove $Q \Rightarrow P$. If you need both directions, you Must prove
them separately.

### Pitfall 5: Misapplying .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic by contradiction

Proof by contradiction is not the same as .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic by
contrapositive. In a .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic by contradiction, you Assume the
**negation of the entire statement** and derive any contradiction. In a
.../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic by Contrapositive, you assume $\neg Q$ and derive
$\neg P$. The contrapositive method is often cleaner Because it targets a specific conclusion rather
than hunting for any contradiction.

### Pitfall 6: Incomplete case analysis

When using .../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic by cases, the cases must be **exhaustive**
(cover all possibilities) and **mutually Exclusive** (no overlap). For example, splitting integers
into "even" and "odd" is exhaustive and Mutually exclusive. Splitting real numbers into "$x \gt 0$"
and "$x \lt 0$" is **not** exhaustive -- You must include "$x = 0$".

## Problem Set

### Problem 1

State the converse and contrapositive of: "If $n$ is a multiple of 6, then $n$ is even." Determine
Whether each is true.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Original: $n$ is a multiple of 6 $\Rightarrow$ $n$ is even. (True: $n = 6k = 2(3k)$.)

Converse: If $n$ is even, then $n$ is a multiple of 6. (False: $n = 4$ is even but not a multiple of
6.)

Contrapositive: If $n$ is not even (i.e. $n$ is odd), then $n$ is not a multiple of 6. (True:
Contrapositive of a true statement is always true. Also directly: no odd number is divisible by 6.)

</details>

### Problem 2

Prove by contradiction that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Assume $\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b$ are coprime integers and $b \neq 0$. Then:

$$3 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = 3b^2$$

So $a^2$ is a multiple of 3, which means $a$ is a multiple of 3 (if 3 divides $a^2$Then 3 must
Divide $a$). Write $a = 3k$. Substituting:

$$9k^2 = 3b^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b^2 = 3k^2$$

So $b^2$ is a multiple of 3, meaning $b$ is a multiple of 3. But then both $a$ and $b$ are multiples
Of 3, contradicting $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Hence $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. $\square$

</details>

### Problem 3

Negate: "For all integers $n$If $n$ is prime then $n$ is odd or $n = 2$."

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Step 1: Negate the universal quantifier. "There exists an integer $n$ such that it is **not** the
Case that (if $n$ is prime then $n$ is odd or $n = 2$)."

Step 2: Negate the implication. "$P \Rightarrow Q$" negates to "$P$ and $\neg Q$". So: "$n$ is prime
And $\neg(n \mathrm{ is odd or } n = 2)$."

Step 3: Apply De Morgan's law. $\neg(A \lor B) = (\neg A) \land (\neg B)$. So: "$n$ is even and
$n \neq 2$."

Full negation: "There exists an integer $n$ such that $n$ is prime and $n$ is even and $n \neq 2$."

Since no such integer exists (the only even prime is 2), the negation is false, confirming the
Original statement is true.

### Problem 4

Let $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$. A student claims: "For all real $x$, $f(x) \ge 0$." Disprove by
Counterexample.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Factorise: $f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)$. Testing $x = 2.5$:

$$f(2.5) = (2.5 - 2)(2.5 - 3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 \lt 0$$

So $f(2.5) \lt 0$Providing a counterexample. The claim is false. (In fact, $f(x) \ge 0$ only when
$x \le 2$ or $x \ge 3$.)

</details>

### Problem 5

Prove by cases: for all integers $n$, $n^2 + n$ is even.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Case 1: $n$ is even.** Then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

$$n^2 + n = 4k^2 + 2k = 2(2k^2 + k)$$

Since $2k^2 + k$ is an integer, $n^2 + n$ is even.

**Case 2: $n$ is odd.** Then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.

$$n^2 + n = (2k+1)^2 + (2k+1) = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 2k + 1 = 4k^2 + 6k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1)$$

Since $2k^2 + 3k + 1$ is an integer, $n^2 + n$ is even.

In both cases $n^2 + n$ is even. $\square$

</details>

### Problem 6

A student writes the following ".../1-number-and-algebra/3_proof-and-logic". Identify the error.

"Claim: If $x^2 = y^2$Then $x = y$.

Proof: $x^2 = y^2$. Taking square roots, $x = y$. QED."

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The error is in the step "taking square roots gives $x = y$". This is invalid because
$\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$Not $x$. From $x^2 = y^2$ we get $|x| = |y|$Which means $x = y$ or $x = -y$.

Counterexample: $x = 3$, $y = -3$. Then $x^2 = 9 = y^2$But $3 \neq -3$.

The correct statement is: "If $x^2 = y^2$Then $x = y$ or $x = -y$."

</details>

### Problem 7

Prove by contrapositive: if $3n + 2$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The contrapositive is: if $n$ is not odd (i.e. $n$ is even), then $3n + 2$ is not odd (i.e. $3n + 2$
Is even).

**Proof.** Let $n$ be even, so $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then:

$$3n + 2 = 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)$$

Since $3k + 1$ is an integer, $3n + 2$ is even. By contrapositive, if $3n + 2$ is odd then $n$ is
Odd. $\square$

</details>

### Problem 8

Prove by contradiction: there is no largest integer.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Assume, for contradiction, that there is a largest integer. Call it $N$. Then for every integer $n$
$n \le N$. But $N + 1$ is an integer and $N + 1 \gt N$Contradicting the assumption that $N$ is the
Largest integer. Hence there is no largest integer. $\square$

</details>

### Problem 9

Determine whether each condition is necessary, sufficient, both, or neither for "$n$ is divisible by
15":

(a) $n$ is divisible by 3.

(b) $n$ is divisible by 3 and by 5.

(c) $n$ is divisible by 30.

(d) $n$ ends in the digit 5.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(a) **Necessary but not sufficient.** If $15 \mid n$ then $3 \mid n$ (so necessary). But $3 \mid 6$
While $15 \nmid 6$ (so not sufficient).

(b) **Necessary and sufficient.** $3 \mid n$ and $5 \mid n$ together mean $n$ is a common multiple
Of 3 and 5. Since $\gcd(3, 5) = 1$The least common multiple is $15$So $15 \mid n$.

(c) **Sufficient but not necessary.** If $30 \mid n$ then $15 \mid n$ (since $30 = 2 \times 15$).
But $15 \mid 15$ while $30 \nmid 15$.

(d) **Neither.** Not sufficient: $25$ ends in 5 but $15 \nmid 25$. Not necessary: $30$ is divisible
By 15 but does not end in 5.

</details>

### Problem 10

Let $P$ and $Q$ be statements. In terms of $P$ and $Q$Express: "It is not the case that both $P$ And
$Q$ are true." Show that this is logically equivalent to "At least one of $P$, $Q$ is false."

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

"It is not the case that both $P$ and $Q$ are true" is $\neg(P \land Q)$.

By De Morgan's law: $\neg(P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P) \lor (\neg Q)$.

"At least one of $P$, $Q$ is false" means either $P$ is false or $Q$ is false (or both), which is
Precisely $\neg P \lor \neg Q$.

Therefore the two statements are logically equivalent. This can also be verified by truth table:

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P \land Q$ | $\neg(P \land Q)$ | $\neg P$ | $\neg Q$ | $\neg P \lor \neg Q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| T   | T   | T           | F                 | F        | F        | F                    |
| T   | F   | F           | T                 | F        | T        | T                    |
| F   | T   | F           | T                 | T        | F        | T                    |
| F   | F   | F           | T                 | T        | T        | T                    |

The fourth and seventh columns are identical, confirming equivalence.

</details>

## Common Pitfalls

1. Dropping negative signs during algebraic manipulation. Substitute back to verify your answer.

2. Misreading the question, particularly with 'hence' vs 'hence or otherwise'. The former requires
   using previous work.

3. Confusing the converse with the contrapositive. Only the contrapositive is logically equivalent
   to the original implication.
