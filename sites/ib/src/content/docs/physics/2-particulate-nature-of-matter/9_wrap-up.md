<summary><strong>B.1 Thermal Energy Transfers, B.2 Greenhouse Effect & B.3 Gas Laws</strong></summary>

1. **Question:** A 0.50 kg block of ice is initially at -15°C. It is placed on a large, dark-colored
   metal plate (emissivity 0.90) of area 0.20 m² that is in direct sunlight. The intensity of the
   solar radiation incident on the plate is 800 W/m², and the plate reflects 10% of this radiation.
   The plate loses energy only through radiation. A) Calculate the steady-state temperature of the
   metal plate before the ice is placed on it. B) Calculate the total thermal energy required to
   turn the -15°C ice into water at 20°C. C) Assuming the plate remains at the temperature
   calculated in (a), and heat is transferred to the ice block perfectly via conduction, how long
   will this process take? (Data: Specific heat of ice = 2100 J kg⁻¹K⁻¹, Specific heat of water =
   4200 J kg⁻¹K⁻¹, Specific latent heat of fusion of ice = 3.3x10⁵ J kg⁻¹)

### Details

<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Strategy:** (a) Use energy balance (power in = power out) for the plate. (b) A three-stage heat
  calculation. (c) Use the concept of power to find time.
- **a) Plate Temperature:**
- The plate reflects 10%, so it absorbs 90%. Power absorbed:
  $P_{\mathrm{in}} = (\mathrm{Intensity}) \times (\mathrm{Area}) \times (\mathrm{Absorptivity}) = 800 \times 0.20 \times 0.90 = 144$
  W.
- Power radiated (out): $P_{\mathrm{out}} = e \sigma A T^4$Where $e=0.90$.
- In equilibrium,
  $P_{\mathrm{in}} = P_{\mathrm{out}} \implies 144 = (0.90)(5.67\times 10^{-8})(0.20)T^4$.
- $T^4 = \frac{144}{1.02\times 10^{-8}} = 1.41 \times 10^{10}$ K⁴ $\implies T = 344.6$ K (or
  71.6°C).
- **b) Total Energy for Ice/Water:**
- 1. Heat ice from -15°C to 0°C: $Q_1 = mc_{\mathrm{ice}}\Delta T = (0.50)(2100)(15) = 15,750$ J.
- 1. Melt ice at 0°C: $Q_2 = mL_f = (0.50)(3.3\times 10^5) = 165,000$ J.
- 1. Heat water from 0°C to 20°C: $Q_3 = mc_{\mathrm{water}}\Delta T = (0.50)(4200)(20) = 42,000$
      J.
- Total Energy: $Q_{\mathrm{total}} = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 = 15750 + 165000 + 42000 = 222,750$ J.
- **c) Time to Transfer Energy:**
- The net power available from the plate is the power it absorbs from the sun, which is 144 W. We
  assume all this power is conducted into the ice.
- Power is the rate of energy transfer: $P = \frac{Q}{t} \implies t = \frac{Q_{\mathrm{total}}}{P}$.
- $t = \frac{222750 \mathrm{ J}}{144 \mathrm{ W}} = 1547$ s (or about 25.8 minutes).

<b>If you get this wrong, you should focus on:</b> Applying the energy balance principle for
Radiation, breaking down a phase change problem into its distinct heating and melting stages, and
Understanding the relationship between power and energy transfer over time ($P=E/t$).

1. **Question:** A sealed vertical cylinder with a frictionless piston contains 0.10 moles of a
   monatomic ideal gas. The piston has a mass of 5.0 kg and an area of 0.010 m². The system is in a
   room at 293 K and atmospheric pressure is $1.01 \times 10^5$ Pa. A) Calculate the initial volume
   of the gas. B) The gas is slowly heated, causing it to expand isobarically until its volume
   doubles. Calculate the work done by the gas and the amount of heat supplied.

</details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Strategy:** First determine the pressure inside the cylinder by considering the equilibrium of
  the piston. Use the Ideal Gas Law for the initial volume. Apply thermodynamics for an isobaric
  process for part (b).
- **a) Initial Volume:**
- The piston is in equilibrium. The pressure from the gas ($P_{\mathrm{gas}}$) must support the
  piston"s weight and the atmospheric pressure ($P_{\mathrm{atm}}$).
- $P_{\mathrm{gas}} A = P_{\mathrm{atm}} A + mg$.
- $P_{\mathrm{gas}} = P_{\mathrm{atm}} + \frac{mg}{A} = (1.01 \times 10^5) + \frac{(5.0)(9.8)}{0.010} = 1.01 \times 10^5 + 4900 = 1.059 \times 10^5$
  Pa.
- Now use the Ideal Gas Law:
  $V_1 = \frac{nRT_1}{P_{\mathrm{gas}}} = \frac{(0.10)(8.31)(293)}{1.059 \times 10^5} = 0.00230 \mathrm{ m}^3$.
- **b) Work and Heat for Isobaric Expansion:**
- The process is isobaric, so the pressure remains $P_{\mathrm{gas}} = 1.059 \times 10^5$ Pa. The
  volume doubles, so $V_2 = 2V_1 = 0.00460$ m³.
- **Work Done:**
  $W = P \Delta V = (1.059 \times 10^5)(V_2 - V_1) = (1.059 \times 10^5)(0.00230) = 243.6$ J.
- **Heat Supplied:** For an isobaric process, $Q = \Delta U + W$. - The temperature also doubles:
  $T_2 = 2T_1 = 586$ K. -
  $\Delta U = \frac{3}{2}nR\Delta T = \frac{3}{2}(0.10)(8.31)(586 - 293) = 365.3$ J. -
  $Q = 365.3 + 243.6 = 608.9$ J.

<b>If you get this wrong, you should focus on:</b> Calculating pressure in a system with a piston,
Correctly applying the Ideal Gas Law, and using the First Law of Thermodynamics for a specific
Process (isobaric), remembering to calculate both the change in internal energy and the work done.

1. **Question (HL Only):** A Carnot engine operates between a hot reservoir at 600 K and a cold
   reservoir at 300 K. In one cycle, it absorbs 2000 J of heat from the hot reservoir. The work
   output from this Carnot engine is used to drive a Carnot refrigerator operating between the same
   two reservoirs. A) What is the efficiency of the Carnot engine and how much work does it produce
   per cycle? b) What is the coefficient of performance (COP) of the Carnot refrigerator? c) How
   much heat can the refrigerator remove from the cold reservoir in one cycle, using the work
   produced by the engine?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Strategy:** Calculate efficiency and work for the engine. Calculate the COP for the
  refrigerator. Use the definition of COP and the work input to find the heat removed.
- **a) Engine Efficiency and Work:**
- Efficiency of a Carnot engine: $\eta = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} = 1 - \frac{300}{600} = 0.50$ (or 50%).
- Efficiency is also defined as $\eta = \frac{W}{Q_h}$.
- Work produced per cycle: $W = \eta \cdot Q_h = 0.50 \times 2000 \mathrm{ J} = 1000 \mathrm{ J}$.
- **b) Refrigerator Coefficient of Performance:**
- For a refrigerator, the goal is to remove heat $Q_c$ from the cold reservoir.
- COP (cooling) is defined as $COP = \frac{Q_c}{W}$.
- For an ideal (Carnot) refrigerator,
  $COP_{\mathrm{Carnot}} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c} = \frac{300}{600 - 300} = 1.0$.
- **c) Heat Removed by Refrigerator:**
- The refrigerator is driven by the 1000 J of work from the engine, so $W = 1000$ J.
- Using the COP definition: $Q_c = COP \cdot W = 1.0 \times 1000 \mathrm{ J} = 1000 \mathrm{ J}$.
- The refrigerator can remove 1000 J of heat from the cold reservoir per cycle.

<b>If you get this wrong, you should focus on:</b> The distinction between a heat engine and a
Refrigerator, the correct formulas for Carnot efficiency and Carnot COP, and how the work output of
An engine serves as the work input for another device.

1. **Question (HL Only):** 1.0 mole of a monatomic ideal gas is initially at state A (300 K,
   $1.0 \times 10^5$ Pa). It is adiabatically compressed to half its original volume, reaching state
   B. It is then cooled at constant volume back to its original temperature, reaching state C. A)
   Calculate the temperature and pressure at state B. B) Calculate the change in entropy of the gas
   during the process B -> C.

</details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Strategy:** Use the adiabatic relation ($PV^\gamma = \mathrm{const.}$) to find the state
  variables at B. For the entropy change, use the formula $\Delta S = \int \frac{dQ}{T}$ for the
  constant volume process.
- **a) State B (after adiabatic compression):**
- For a monatomic ideal gas, the adiabatic index $\gamma = 5/3$.
- Initial volume $V_A = \frac{nRT_A}{P_A} = \frac{1.0(8.31)(300)}{1.0 \times 10^5} = 0.0249$ m³.
- Final volume $V_B = V_A/2 = 0.01245$ m³.
- **Pressure at B:** Use $P_A V_A^\gamma = P_B V_B^\gamma$.
- $P_B = P_A \left(\frac{V_A}{V_B}\right)^\gamma = (1.0 \times 10^5) (2)^{5/3} = 3.17 \times 10^5$
  Pa.
- **Temperature at B:** Use the ideal gas law: $T_B = \frac{P_B V_B}{nR}$.
- $T_B = \frac{(3.17 \times 10^5)(0.01245)}{(1.0)(8.31)} = 475$ K.
- Alternatively, use
  $T_A V_A^{\gamma-1} = T_B V_B^{\gamma-1} \implies T_B = T_A (V_A/V_B)^{\gamma-1} = 300(2)^{2/3} = 476$
  K. (Slight difference due to rounding). Let's use 476 K.
- **b) Entropy Change (B -> C):**
- Process B -> C is isochoric (constant volume). The temperature changes from $T_B = 476$ K to
  $T_C = T_A = 300$ K.
- For a constant volume process, $dQ = dU = nC_V dT = \frac{3}{2}nR dT$.
- The change in entropy is
  $\Delta S = \int_{T_B}^{T_C} \frac{dQ}{T} = \int_{T_B}^{T_C} \frac{nC_V dT}{T} = nC_V \ln\left(\frac{T_C}{T_B}\right)$.
- $\Delta S = \frac{3}{2}nR \ln\left(\frac{T_C}{T_B}\right) = \frac{3}{2}(1.0)(8.31) \ln\left(\frac{300}{476}\right)$.
- $\Delta S = 12.465 \times (-0.462) = -5.76$ J K⁻¹.
- The entropy decreases, as expected, since heat is being removed from the system.

<b>If you get this wrong, you should focus on:</b> The specific gas law relations for an adiabatic
Process ($PV^\gamma=\mathrm{const.}$, $TV^{\gamma-1}=\mathrm{const.}$). Also, the formula for
Calculating entropy change during a process with a changing temperature, which requires integration
Or the logarithmic form.

1. **Question:** A circuit is constructed with a 12.0 V battery with an internal resistance of 0.50
   Ω. It is connected to a 2.0 Ω resistor in series with a parallel combination of a 3.0 Ω resistor
   and a 6.0 Ω resistor. A) Calculate the total equivalent resistance of the external circuit. B)
   Calculate the total current flowing from the battery. C) What is the terminal potential
   difference of the battery when this circuit is connected? d) What is the power dissipated in the
   3.0 Ω resistor?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Strategy:** Systematically reduce the circuit to find total resistance. Use Ohm's Law including
  internal resistance. Work backwards to find current and power in a specific branch.
- **a) Equivalent Resistance:**
- First, find the equivalent resistance of the parallel part ($R_p$):
- $\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{3.0} + \frac{1}{6.0} = \frac{2+1}{6.0} = \frac{3.0}{6.0} = 0.5 \implies R_p = 2.0 \Omega$.
- Now, add the series resistor: $R_{\mathrm{external}} = 2.0 \Omega + R_p = 2.0 + 2.0 = 4.0 \Omega$.
- **b) Total Current:**
- The total resistance of the entire circuit is
  $R_{\mathrm{total}} = R_{\mathrm{external}} + r = 4.0 + 0.50 = 4.5 \Omega$.
- Use Ohm's Law for the whole circuit:
  $I_{\mathrm{total}} = \frac{\varepsilon}{R_{\mathrm{total}}} = \frac{12.0 \mathrm{ V}}{4.5 \Omega} = 2.67$
  A.
- **c) Terminal Potential Difference:**
- The terminal PD is the voltage across the external circuit:
  $V_{\mathrm{terminal}} = I_{\mathrm{total}} R_{\mathrm{external}} = (2.67 \mathrm{ A})(4.0 \Omega) = 10.67$
  V.
- Alternatively, it's the EMF minus the "lost volts":
  $V_{\mathrm{terminal}} = \varepsilon - I_{\mathrm{total}} r = 12.0 - (2.67)(0.50) = 12.0 - 1.335 = 10.67$
  V.
- **d) Power in 3.0 Ω Resistor:**
- First, find the voltage across the parallel combination ($V_p$). This is the total current times
  the parallel equivalent resistance.
- $V_p = I_{\mathrm{total}} R_p = (2.67 \mathrm{ A})(2.0 \Omega) = 5.34$ V.
- This voltage is the same across both the 3.0 Ω and 6.0 Ω resistors.
- Now, find the power dissipated in the 3.0 Ω resistor using $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$. -
  $P_{3\Omega} = \frac{(5.34 \mathrm{ V})^2}{3.0 \Omega} = 9.5$ W.

<b>If you get this wrong, you should focus on:</b> The rules for combining series and parallel
Resistors, the concept of internal resistance and terminal PD, and using the potential divider rule
(or working backwards through the circuit) to find voltage/current for a specific component.

## Fluid Mechanics and Pressure

Pressure is defined as force per unit area:

$$P = \frac{F}{A}$$

The SI unit is the pascal (Pa), where $1 \mathrm{ Pa} = 1 \mathrm{ N m}^{-2}$.

**Hydrostatic pressure** in a fluid column of density $\rho$ at depth $h$ is:

$$P = P_0 + \rho g h$$

Where $P_0$ is the pressure at the surface (often atmospheric pressure,
$P_{\mathrm{atm}} \approx 1.01 \times 10^5$ Pa).

**Pascal's principle:** A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted
Undiminished to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the container. This is the basis of
Hydraulic systems:

$$\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}$$

### Worked Example: Hydraulic Lift

A hydraulic lift has a small piston of area $0.010 \mathrm{ m}^2$ and a large piston of area
$0.50 \mathrm{ m}^2$. A force of $200$ N is applied to the small piston.

- **Pressure transmitted:** $P = \frac{200}{0.010} = 2.0 \times 10^4$ Pa
- **Force on large piston:** $F_2 = P \times A_2 = (2.0 \times 10^4)(0.50) = 1.0 \times 10^4$ N
- **Mechanical advantage:** $\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^4}{200} = 50$

The trade-off is that the small piston must move 50 times farther than the large piston (energy
Conservation).

> **Exam Tip:** When asked about hydraulic systems, always mention that energy is conserved:
> $F_1 d_1 = F_2 d_2$ So a large force multiplication comes at the cost of a large distance on the
> input side.

## Archimedes' Principle

**Archimedes' principle:** An object wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upward
Buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.

$$F_b = \rho_{\mathrm{fluid}} \cdot V_{\mathrm{submerged}} \cdot g$$

An object floats when $F_b = mg$I.e., when:

$$\rho_{\mathrm{fluid}} \cdot V_{\mathrm{submerged}} \cdot g = \rho_{\mathrm{object}} \cdot V_{\mathrm{object}} \cdot g$$

This simplifies to the **fraction submerged**:

$$\mathrm{Fraction submerged} = \frac{\rho_{\mathrm{object}}}{\rho_{\mathrm{fluid}}}$$

### Worked Example: Floating Block

A wooden block of density $600 \mathrm{ kg m}^{-3}$ and volume $0.0050 \mathrm{ m}^3$ floats in
Water ($\rho = 1000 \mathrm{ kg m}^{-3}$).

- **Fraction submerged:** $\frac{600}{1000} = 0.60$ (60% underwater)
- **Volume submerged:** $0.60 \times 0.0050 = 0.0030 \mathrm{ m}^3$
- **Buoyant force:** $F_b = (1000)(0.0030)(9.8) = 29.4$ N
- **Weight of block:** $mg = (600)(0.0050)(9.8) = 29.4$ N (confirms equilibrium)

> **Exam Tip:** A common IB question asks whether an object will float or sink. Compare the average
> density of the object to the density of the fluid. If
> $\rho_{\mathrm{object}} \lt \rho_{\mathrm{fluid}}$It floats.

## Bernoulli's Equation

For an **ideal fluid** (incompressible, non-viscous, steady flow), Bernoulli's equation states that
Along a streamline:

$$P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h = \mathrm{constant}$$

This is a statement of **conservation of energy** per unit volume of fluid:

- $P$ — pressure energy per unit volume
- $\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$ — kinetic energy per unit volume
- $\rho g h$ — gravitational potential energy per unit volume

**Key consequence — the Venturi effect:** Where the fluid speed increases, the pressure decreases.
For a horizontal pipe ($h = \mathrm{const.}$):

$$P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2$$

Combined with the **continuity equation** (conservation of mass for incompressible flow):

$$A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$$

### Worked Example: Pipe Flow

Water flows through a pipe that narrows from cross-sectional area $A_1 = 0.050 \mathrm{ m}^2$ to
$A_2 = 0.020 \mathrm{ m}^2$. The water speed in the wider section is $2.0 \mathrm{ m s}^{-1}$ and
The pressure there is $1.5 \times 10^5$ Pa.

- **Speed in narrow section:**
  $v_2 = \frac{A_1 v_1}{A_2} = \frac{(0.050)(2.0)}{0.020} = 5.0 \mathrm{ m s}^{-1}$
- **Pressure in narrow section (horizontal):**
  $$P_2 = P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho(v_1^2 - v_2^2) = 1.5 \times 10^5 + \frac{1}{2}(1000)(4.0 - 25.0)$$
  $$P_2 = 1.5 \times 10^5 - 10500 = 1.395 \times 10^5 \mathrm{ Pa}$$

The pressure **drops** where the fluid speeds up — this is the Venturi effect.

> **Exam Tip:** Bernoulli's equation explains lift on an aeroplane wing (airfoil), the operation of
> a spray bottle, and why a roof can blow off in high winds. Be ready to apply it conceptually as
> well as mathematically.

## Ideal Gas Behaviour

### Kinetic Theory of Gases

The ideal gas model makes the following assumptions:

1. Gas consists of many small particles in rapid, random motion
2. Collisions between particles and with walls are perfectly elastic
3. The volume of individual particles is negligible compared to the container volume
4. Intermolecular forces are negligible (except during collisions)
5. The duration of collisions is negligible compared to time between collisions

### Macroscopic Gas Laws

| Law              | Relationship            | Constant Quantity |
| :--------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------- |
| Boyle's Law      | $P \propto \frac{1}{V}$ | $T$, $n$          |
| Charles's Law    | $V \propto T$           | $P$, $n$          |
| Gay-Lussac's Law | $P \propto T$           | $V$, $n$          |

All of these are unified in the **ideal gas equation**:

$$PV = nRT$$

Where $R = 8.31 \mathrm{ J mol}^{-1}\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the
Absolute temperature in Kelvin.

### Microscopic Basis: Pressure from Molecular Collisions

From kinetic theory, the pressure of an ideal gas arises from molecular collisions with the
Container walls:

$$P = \frac{1}{3}\frac{N}{V} m \langle c^2 \rangle$$

Where $N$ is the number of molecules, $m$ is the mass of one molecule, and $\langle c^2 \rangle$ is
The mean square speed.

Combining with $PV = Nk_BT$ (where $k_B = \frac{R}{N_A}$ is Boltzmann's constant):

$$\frac{1}{2}m\langle c^2 \rangle = \frac{3}{2}k_BT$$

The **root-mean-square speed** is:

$$c_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\langle c^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{3k_BT}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}$$

Where $M$ is the molar mass (kg mol$^{-1}$).

### Worked Example: RMS Speed

Calculate the rms speed of nitrogen molecules ($M = 0.028 \mathrm{ kg mol}^{-1}$) at $300$ K.

$$c_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3(8.31)(300)}{0.028}} = \sqrt{\frac{7479}{0.028}} = \sqrt{267107} \approx 517 \mathrm{ m s}^{-1}$$

> **Exam Tip:** When converting between $c_{\mathrm{rms}}$ forms, remember that $m$ is the mass of a
> **single molecule** ($m = M/N_A$) while $M$ is the **molar mass**. Mixing these up is a very
> common error.

### Real Gases vs Ideal Gases

Real gases deviate from ideal behaviour at **high pressure** and **low temperature** because:

- Molecules have finite volume (significant at high $P$)
- Intermolecular forces become significant (significant at low $T$)

The **van der Waals equation** corrects for these:

$$\left(P + \frac{an^2}{V^2}\right)(V - nb) = nRT$$

Where $a$ accounts for intermolecular attraction and $b$ accounts for molecular volume.

## Phase Changes

### Heating Curve

When a substance is heated, its temperature does not always increase. A typical heating curve shows
Five regions:

1. **Solid heating:** $Q = mc_s \Delta T$ (temperature rises)
2. **Melting (fusion):** $Q = mL_f$ (temperature stays constant at $T_f$)
3. **Liquid heating:** $Q = mc_l \Delta T$ (temperature rises)
4. **Boiling (vaporisation):** $Q = mL_v$ (temperature stays constant at $T_b$)
5. **Gas heating:** $Q = mc_g \Delta T$ (temperature rises)

During phase changes, energy goes into **breaking or forming intermolecular bonds**, not increasing
Kinetic energy.

### Key Definitions

| Quantity                             | Symbol | Definition                   | Unit                 |
| :----------------------------------- | :----- | :--------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Specific heat capacity               | $c$    | Energy to raise 1 kg by 1 K  | J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ |
| Specific latent heat of fusion       | $L_f$  | Energy to melt 1 kg at $T_f$ | J kg$^{-1}$          |
| Specific latent heat of vaporisation | $L_v$  | Energy to boil 1 kg at $T_b$ | J kg$^{-1}$          |

### Evaporation vs Boiling

| Property      | Evaporation                      | Boiling                       |
| :------------ | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Temperature   | Occurs at any temperature        | Occurs at a specific $T_b$    |
| Location      | Surface only                     | Throughout the liquid         |
| Bubbles       | No                               | Yes                           |
| Energy source | From the liquid itself (cooling) | External heat source required |

### Pressure and Boiling Point

Boiling occurs when the **saturated vapour pressure** equals the external (atmospheric) pressure.
Therefore:

- Higher external pressure produces a higher boiling point (e.g., pressure cooker)
- Lower external pressure produces a lower boiling point (e.g., water boils at ~70 degrees C on
  Mount Everest)

### Worked Example: Phase Change Energy

Calculate the total energy required to convert $2.0$ kg of ice at $-20$ degrees C to steam at $120$
Degrees C. (Data: $c_{\mathrm{ice}} = 2100$ J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, $c_{\mathrm{water}} = 4200$ J
Kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$$c_{\mathrm{steam}} = 2000$ J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$$L_f = 3.34 \times 10^5$ J
Kg$^{-1}$$L_v = 2.26 \times 10^6$ J kg$^{-1}$)

| Stage                           | Calculation               | Energy (J)                |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| Ice: $-20$ to $0$ degrees C     | $(2.0)(2100)(20)$         | 84,000                    |
| Melting at $0$ degrees C        | $(2.0)(3.34 \times 10^5)$ | 668,000                   |
| Water: $0$ to $100$ degrees C   | $(2.0)(4200)(100)$        | 840,000                   |
| Boiling at $100$ degrees C      | $(2.0)(2.26 \times 10^6)$ | 4,520,000                 |
| Steam: $100$ to $120$ degrees C | $(2.0)(2000)(20)$         | 80,000                    |
| **Total**                       |                           | **6,192,000 J (6.19 MJ)** |

> **Exam Tip:** IB examiners frequently ask multi-stage heating problems. Always identify each
> stage, write the formula, and compute separately before summing. Forgetting the phase change
> stages (where $\Delta T = 0$ but $Q \neq 0$) is the most common mistake.

## Intuition

Thermal physics connects microscopic molecular motion to macroscopic temperature and pressure. The ideal gas law emerges from countless molecular collisions, each tiny impact contributing to the pressure we measure. Heat is energy in transit, flowing from hot to cold like water flowing downhill. Phase changes occur when molecules gain enough energy to break their bonds, and the latent heat represents this hidden energy cost. Thermodynamics governs energy conversion limits, with entropy always increasing in isolated systems, explaining why perpetual motion machines are impossible.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using the wrong equation from the data sheet. Take time to read the full equation, including
   conditions and variable definitions.

2. Incorrectly applying $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ when forces are not collinear. Resolve into components
   first.

3. Confusing scalar and vector quantities. Always check whether direction matters for the quantity
   in question.

4. Rounding intermediate answers too early, which compounds errors in multi-step calculations.
