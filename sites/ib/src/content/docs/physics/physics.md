### Worked Example: Projectile Motion (A.1)

A ball is thrown from the edge of a cliff 45.0 m high with an initial velocity of 25.0 m/s at an
Angle of 35.0 degrees above the horizontal. Find: (a) the time it takes to hit the ground, (b) the
Horizontal range, and (c) the speed of the ball just before impact.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Resolve the initial velocity:**
- $u_x = 25.0\cos 35.0^\circ = 20.48$ m/s
- $u_y = 25.0\sin 35.0^\circ = 14.34$ m/s
- **(a) Time of flight:** Use the vertical SUVAT equation with $s_y = -45.0$ m, $a_y = -9.81$
  m/s$^2$:
- $s_y = u_y t + \tfrac{1}{2}a_y t^2$
- $-45.0 = 14.34t - 4.905t^2$
- $4.905t^2 - 14.34t - 45.0 = 0$
- $t = \dfrac{14.34 \pm \sqrt{14.34^2 + 4 \times 4.905 \times 45.0}}{2 \times 4.905}$
- $t = \dfrac{14.34 + \sqrt{205.6 + 882.9}}{9.81} = \dfrac{14.34 + 32.99}{9.81} = 4.81$ s
- **(b) Horizontal range:**
- $R = u_x \times t = 20.48 \times 4.81 = 98.5$ m
- **(c) Final speed:** Find the final vertical velocity, then use Pythagoras:
- $v_y = u_y + a_y t = 14.34 + (-9.81)(4.81) = -32.84$ m/s
- $v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \sqrt{20.48^2 + (-32.84)^2} = \sqrt{419.4 + 1078.5} = 38.7$ m/s

</details>

### Worked Example: Conservation of Momentum (A.2)

A 1500 kg car travelling east at 20.0 m/s collides with a 2500 kg truck travelling west at 15.0 m/s.
After the collision the two vehicles stick together. Find their common velocity and the kinetic
energy Lost in the collision.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Define east as positive.** Initial velocities: car $= +20.0$ m/s, truck $= -15.0$ m/s.
- **Conservation of momentum:** $m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1 + m_2)v$
- $(1500)(20.0) + (2500)(-15.0) = (1500 + 2500)v$
- $30000 - 37500 = 4000v$
- $v = -1.88$ m/s (the combined wreck moves west at 1.88 m/s)
- **Kinetic energy before:** $E_{k,i} = \tfrac{1}{2}(1500)(20.0)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}(2500)(15.0)^2$
- $= 300000 + 281250 = 581250$ J
- **Kinetic energy after:** $E_{k,f} = \tfrac{1}{2}(4000)(1.88)^2 = 7070$ J
- **Energy lost:** $\Delta E_k = 581250 - 7070 = 574180$ J $\approx 574$ kJ

</details>

### Worked Example: Centripetal Force (A.2)

A $0.50$ kg ball is attached to a string of length $0.80$ m and whirled in a horizontal circle at A
constant speed of $4.0$ m/s. Calculate the tension in the string and the period of revolution.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The tension provides the centripetal force:

- **Tension:** $T = \dfrac{mv^2}{r} = \dfrac{(0.50)(4.0)^2}{0.80} = \dfrac{8.0}{0.80} = 10$ N
- **Period:** $T = \dfrac{2\pi r}{v} = \dfrac{2\pi(0.80)}{4.0} = 1.26$ s

Note: In a true horizontal circle, gravity would cause the string to angle downward. This
Calculation assumes the circular path is horizontal and gravity is balanced by another force.

</details>

### Worked Example: Power and Efficiency (A.3)

A pump lifts $1200$ kg of water per minute from a well $15$ m deep. The pump has an efficiency Of
65%. Calculate the power input to the pump.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Useful power output** (work done per second against gravity):
- $P_{\mathrm{useful}} = \dfrac{mgh}{t} = \dfrac{(1200)(9.81)(15)}{60} = 2943$ W
- **Power input:**
- $P_{\mathrm{input}} = \dfrac{P_{\mathrm{useful}}}{\eta} = \dfrac{2943}{0.65} = 4530$ W
  $\approx 4.5$ kW

The remaining 35% of the input power is wasted as heat and sound.

</details>

### Worked Example: Conservation of Energy (A.3)

A 2.00 kg block is released from rest at the top of a smooth curved ramp of height 3.50 m. At the
Bottom it slides across a rough horizontal surface ($\mu_k = 0.30$) before hitting a spring with
spring Constant $k = 500$ N/m. Find the maximum compression of the spring.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Step 1: Speed at the bottom of the ramp.** Using conservation of energy (ramp is smooth):
- $mgh = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 \implies v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 3.50} = 8.29$ m/s
- **Step 2: Distance travelled across the rough surface.** The friction force is $f = \mu_k mg$:
- Work-energy: $\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 - \mu_k mg \cdot d = 0$ (all KE converts to work done by friction
  before the spring is reached)
- Actually, we set up the energy balance for the entire process from the bottom of the ramp to
  maximum compression $x$:
- $\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 = \mu_k mg \cdot x + \tfrac{1}{2}kx^2$
- $\tfrac{1}{2}(2.00)(8.29)^2 = (0.30)(2.00)(9.81)x + \tfrac{1}{2}(500)x^2$
- $68.7 = 5.886x + 250x^2$
- $250x^2 + 5.886x - 68.7 = 0$
- **Solve the quadratic:**
- $x = \dfrac{-5.886 + \sqrt{5.886^2 + 4 \times 250 \times 68.7}}{500}$
- $x = \dfrac{-5.886 + \sqrt{34.64 + 68700}}{500} = \dfrac{-5.886 + 262.3}{500} = 0.513$ m

</details>

### Worked Example: Special Relativity -- Time Dilation (A.5, HL)

A spacecraft travels at $0.85c$ relative to Earth. A clock on the spacecraft measures a time
Interval of $2.0 \times 10^6$ s between two events. What time interval is measured by an observer on
Earth?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Lorentz factor:**
- $\gamma = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.85^2}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{0.2775}} = 1.90$
- **Time dilation:** The spacecraft clock measures the proper time $\Delta t_0$ (events at the same
  position in that frame):
- $\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 = 1.90 \times 2.0 \times 10^6 = 3.8 \times 10^6$ s

The Earth observer measures a longer time interval of $3.8 \times 10^6$ s.

</details>

### Worked Example: Specific and Latent Heat (B.1)

A 0.500 kg block of ice at $-15.0$ degrees Celsius is heated until it becomes water at $25.0$
degrees Celsius. The specific heat capacity of ice is $2.09 \times 10^3$ J/(kg K), the specific
latent heat Of fusion is $3.34 \times 10^5$ J/kg, and the specific heat capacity of water is
$4.18 \times 10^3$ J/(kg K). Calculate the total energy required.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The process has three stages:

- **Stage 1: Heating ice from $-15.0$ degrees Celsius to $0$ degrees Celsius:**
- $Q_1 = m c_{\mathrm{ice}} \Delta T = (0.500)(2.09 \times 10^3)(15.0) = 15675$ J
- **Stage 2: Melting ice at $0$ degrees Celsius:**
- $Q_2 = m L_f = (0.500)(3.34 \times 10^5) = 167000$ J
- **Stage 3: Heating water from $0$ degrees Celsius to $25.0$ degrees Celsius:**
- $Q_3 = m c_{\mathrm{water}} \Delta T = (0.500)(4.18 \times 10^3)(25.0) = 52250$ J
- **Total energy:** $Q = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 = 15675 + 167000 + 52250 = 234925$ J $\approx 235$ kJ

</details>

### Worked Example: Ideal Gas Law (B.3)

A sealed container of volume $0.0200$ m$^3$ holds $2.50$ mol of an ideal gas at a temperature of
$350$ K. Calculate (a) the pressure of the gas, and (b) the rms speed of the gas molecules. Take
$R = 8.31$ J/(mol K) and the molar mass of the gas as $0.0290$ kg/mol.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **(a) Pressure from the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$:**
- $P = \dfrac{nRT}{V} = \dfrac{(2.50)(8.31)(350)}{0.0200} = \dfrac{7271}{0.0200} = 363550$ Pa
  $\approx 364$ kPa
- **(b) RMS speed from $v_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{3RT}{M}}$:**
- $v_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{3 \times 8.31 \times 350}{0.0290}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{8725.5}{0.0290}} = \sqrt{300879} = 548$
  m/s

</details>

### Worked Example: Isothermal Compression (B.3)

A cylinder contains $0.20$ mol of an ideal gas at $300$ K and $1.5 \times 10^5$ Pa. The gas is
Compressed isothermally to half its original volume. Calculate the final pressure and the work Done
on the gas.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Initial volume** from the ideal gas law:
- $V_i = \dfrac{nRT}{P_i} = \dfrac{(0.20)(8.31)(300)}{1.5 \times 10^5} = 3.32 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$
- **Final volume:** $V_f = V_i / 2 = 1.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$
- **Final pressure** (isothermal: $PV = \mathrm{constant}$):
- $P_i V_i = P_f V_f \implies P_f = 1.5 \times 10^5 \times 2 = 3.0 \times 10^5$ Pa
- **Work done on the gas** (isothermal compression):
- $W = nRT \ln\!\left(\dfrac{V_i}{V_f}\right) = (0.20)(8.31)(300) \ln 2$
- $W = 498.6 \times 0.693 = 345$ J

The work done **on** the gas is $345$ J (positive, since volume decreases).

</details>

### Worked Example: Series and Parallel Circuits (B.4)

A 12.0 V battery with negligible internal resistance is connected to two resistors: $R_1 = 4.0$ ohms
In series with a parallel combination of $R_2 = 6.0$ ohms and $R_3 = 3.0$ ohms. Find (a) the total
Resistance, (b) the current from the battery, (c) the potential difference across $R_1$And (d) the
Current through $R_2$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **(a) Total resistance:** The parallel combination first:
- $\dfrac{1}{R_{23}} = \dfrac{1}{6.0} + \dfrac{1}{3.0} = \dfrac{1}{6.0} + \dfrac{2}{6.0} = \dfrac{3}{6.0} = 0.50$
  S
- $R_{23} = 2.0$ ohms
- $R_{\mathrm{total}} = R_1 + R_{23} = 4.0 + 2.0 = 6.0$ ohms
- **(b) Current from battery:**
  $I = \dfrac{\mathrm{emf}}{R_{\mathrm{total}}} = \dfrac{12.0}{6.0} = 2.0$ A
- **(c) PD across $R_1$:** $V_1 = IR_1 = (2.0)(4.0) = 8.0$ V
- **(d) Current through $R_2$:** The PD across the parallel pair is $V_{23} = 12.0 - 8.0 = 4.0$ V:
- $I_2 = \dfrac{V_{23}}{R_2} = \dfrac{4.0}{6.0} = 0.67$ A

</details>

### Worked Example: First Law of Thermodynamics (B.5, HL)

A monatomic ideal gas undergoes an isobaric expansion from $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$ to
$5.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$ at a constant pressure of $1.0 \times 10^5$ Pa. During this process $500$
J of heat is supplied to the gas. Determine the work done by the gas and the change in Internal
energy.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Work done by the gas at constant pressure:**
- $W = P \Delta V = (1.0 \times 10^5)(5.0 \times 10^{-3} - 2.0 \times 10^{-3})$
- $W = (1.0 \times 10^5)(3.0 \times 10^{-3}) = 300$ J
- **Change in internal energy (first law):**
- $\Delta U = Q - W = 500 - 300 = 200$ J
- The internal energy increases by 200 J. For a monatomic ideal gas,
  $\Delta U = \tfrac{3}{2} nR \Delta T$ so we could also find the temperature change from
  $P \Delta V = nR \Delta T = 300$ J, giving $\Delta T = 200 \times \tfrac{2}{3} / (nR)$.

> See [Simple Harmonic Motion](3-wave-behaviour/1_simple-harmonic-motion.mdx) for detailed notes.

### Worked Example: Double-Slit Interference (C.3)

Light of wavelength $590$ nm passes through a double slit with slit separation $0.050$ mm. The
screen Is $1.20$ m away. Calculate (a) the fringe spacing, and (b) the distance from the central
maximum to The third bright fringe.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Given:** $\lambda = 590 \times 10^{-9}$ m, $d = 0.050 \times 10^{-3}$ m, $D = 1.20$ m
- **(a) Fringe spacing** from $s = \dfrac{\lambda D}{d}$:
- $s = \dfrac{(590 \times 10^{-9})(1.20)}{0.050 \times 10^{-3}} = \dfrac{7.08 \times 10^{-7}}{5.0 \times 10^{-5}} = 0.01416$
  m $\approx 14.2$ mm
- **(b) Distance to the third bright fringe:**
- The $n$Th bright fringe is at $y_n = ns$So $y_3 = 3 \times 14.2 = 42.6$ mm

</details>

### Worked Example: Snell's Law and Total Internal Reflection (C.3)

A light ray travels from glass ($n = 1.50$) into water ($n = 1.33$). (a) Find the critical angle.
(b) If the angle of incidence is $55.0$ degrees, find the angle of refraction.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **(a) Critical angle:** Total internal reflection occurs going from a denser to a less dense
  medium, so from glass to water:
- $\sin \theta_c = \dfrac{n_2}{n_1} = \dfrac{1.33}{1.50} = 0.887$
- $\theta_c = \arcsin(0.887) = 62.5$ degrees
- **(b) Angle of refraction at $\theta_i = 55.0$ degrees:**
- $n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$
- $(1.50)\sin 55.0^\circ = (1.33)\sin \theta_2$
- $1.50 \times 0.8192 = 1.33 \sin \theta_2$
- $\sin \theta_2 = \dfrac{1.229}{1.33} = 0.924$
- $\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.924) = 67.5$ degrees

Since $\theta_i \lt \theta_c$The light refracts into the water rather than undergoing TIR.

</details>

### Worked Example: Simple Harmonic Motion (C.1)

A mass of $0.25$ kg is attached to a vertical spring and oscillates with a period of $0.80$ s and An
amplitude of $0.12$ m. Determine the spring constant, the maximum velocity, and the maximum
Acceleration of the mass.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Spring constant** from $T = 2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$:
- $k = \dfrac{4\pi^2 m}{T^2} = \dfrac{4\pi^2(0.25)}{0.80^2} = \dfrac{9.87}{0.64} = 15.4$ N/m
- **Maximum velocity** (at equilibrium position):
- $v_{\max} = \omega A = \dfrac{2\pi A}{T} = \dfrac{2\pi(0.12)}{0.80} = 0.942$ m/s
- **Maximum acceleration** (at maximum displacement):
- $a_{\max} = \omega^2 A = \left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2 A = \left(\dfrac{2\pi}{0.80}\right)^2(0.12)$
- $a_{\max} = (7.85)^2(0.12) = 7.40$ m/s$^2$

</details>

### Worked Example: Simple Pendulum (C.1)

A simple pendulum has a length of $1.50$ m. Calculate its period on Earth ($g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$) and
On the Moon ($g = 1.62$ m/s$^2$). If the pendulum has an amplitude of $0.10$ m, what is the maximum
Speed on Earth?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Period on Earth:**
- $T_E = 2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{L}{g}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{1.50}{9.81}} = 2.46$ s
- **Period on the Moon:**
- $T_M = 2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{1.50}{1.62}} = 6.05$ s
- **Maximum speed on Earth:**
- $v_{\max} = \omega A = \dfrac{2\pi A}{T} = \dfrac{2\pi(0.10)}{2.46} = 0.256$ m/s

The period of a simple pendulum is independent of mass -- a key result to remember.

</details>

### Worked Example: Standing Waves in Pipes (C.5, HL)

A pipe of length $0.85$ m is open at both ends. The speed of sound in air is $340$ m/s. Determine
The fundamental frequency and the frequency of the second harmonic. Repeat for a pipe of the same
Length that is closed at one end.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Open pipe (both ends open):**

- Fundamental: $L = \lambda/2$So $\lambda_1 = 2L = 1.70$ m.
- $f_1 = v/\lambda_1 = 340/1.70 = 200$ Hz
- Second harmonic: $L = \lambda$So $\lambda_2 = L = 0.85$ m.
- $f_2 = v/\lambda_2 = 340/0.85 = 400$ Hz
- Open pipes produce all harmonics: $f_n = n f_1$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$

**Closed pipe (one end closed):**

- Fundamental: $L = \lambda/4$So $\lambda_1 = 4L = 3.40$ m.
- $f_1 = v/\lambda_1 = 340/3.40 = 100$ Hz
- A closed pipe only produces odd harmonics. The "second harmonic" does not exist. The next
  resonance is the **third harmonic**: $f_3 = 3 f_1 = 300$ Hz.

</details>

### Worked Example: Diffraction Grating (C.3)

Monochromatic light of wavelength $620$ nm is directed at a diffraction grating with
$4.0 \times 10^5$ lines per metre. Calculate the angle of the second-order maximum and the total
Number of bright fringes visible on each side of the central maximum.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Slit spacing:** $d = \dfrac{1}{4.0 \times 10^5} = 2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ m
- **Second-order maximum** ($n = 2$): $d \sin \theta = n \lambda$
- $\sin \theta_2 = \dfrac{2(620 \times 10^{-9})}{2.5 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.496$
- $\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.496) = 29.7^{\circ}$
- **Maximum order** (when $\sin \theta = 1$):
- $n_{\max} = \dfrac{d}{\lambda} = \dfrac{2.5 \times 10^{-6}}{620 \times 10^{-9}} = 4.03$
- Since $n$ must be an integer, the maximum order is $n = 4$. Including the central maximum, there
  are $4 + 1 + 4 = 9$ bright fringes total (4 on each side).

Calculate the gravitational field strength at a point $300$ km above the Earth's surface. Given:
$M_{\mathrm{Earth}} = 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg, $R_{\mathrm{Earth}} = 6.37 \times 10^6$ m,
$G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Distance from centre of Earth:**
  $r = R_{\mathrm{Earth}} + h = 6.37 \times 10^6 + 3.00 \times 10^5 = 6.67 \times 10^6$ m
- **Gravitational field strength:** $g = \dfrac{GM}{r^2}$
- $g = \dfrac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})}{(6.67 \times 10^6)^2}$
- $g = \dfrac{3.982 \times 10^{14}}{4.449 \times 10^{13}} = 8.95$ N/kg

</details>

### Worked Example: Orbital Speed and Period (D.1)

A $500$ kg satellite orbits Earth at an altitude of $300$ km. Calculate the orbital speed and the
Orbital period.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Distance from Earth's centre:** $r = 6.37 \times 10^6 + 3.0 \times 10^5 = 6.67 \times 10^6$ m
- **Orbital speed** (equating gravitational force to centripetal force):
- $\dfrac{GMm}{r^2} = \dfrac{mv^2}{r} \implies v = \sqrt{\dfrac{GM}{r}}$
- $v = \sqrt{\dfrac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})}{6.67 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{5.97 \times 10^7} = 7730$
  m/s
- **Orbital period:**
- $T = \dfrac{2\pi r}{v} = \dfrac{2\pi(6.67 \times 10^6)}{7730} = 5420$ s $= 90.4$ min

</details>

### Worked Example: Electric Field and Potential (D.2)

Two point charges, $q_1 = +3.0$ nC and $q_2 = -5.0$ nC, are separated by $0.20$ m. Determine the
Electric field strength and the electric potential at the midpoint between the charges.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Distance from each charge to the midpoint:** $r = 0.10$ m.
- **Electric field due to $q_1$** (pointing away from the positive charge):
- $E_1 = \dfrac{k \lvert q_1 \rvert}{r^2} = \dfrac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(3.0 \times 10^{-9})}{(0.10)^2} = 2700$
  N/C
- **Electric field due to $q_2$** (pointing toward the negative charge):
- $E_2 = \dfrac{k \lvert q_2 \rvert}{r^2} = \dfrac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(5.0 \times 10^{-9})}{(0.10)^2} = 4500$
  N/C
- Both fields point in the same direction (from $q_1$ toward $q_2$), so:
- $E_{\mathrm{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2700 + 4500 = 7200$ N/C
- **Electric potential at the midpoint** (a scalar -- add algebraically):
- $V = \dfrac{k q_1}{r} + \dfrac{k q_2}{r} = \dfrac{k}{r}(q_1 + q_2)$
- $V = \dfrac{8.99 \times 10^9}{0.10}(3.0 \times 10^{-9} + (-5.0 \times 10^{-9}))$
- $V = (8.99 \times 10^{10})(-2.0 \times 10^{-9}) = -180$ V

</details>

### Worked Example: Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge (D.2)

An electron moves at $2.0 \times 10^6$ m/s perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of $0.50$ T.
Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic force and the radius of the circular path.
($m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ kg, $e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C.)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Magnetic force:** $F = qvB \sin \theta$. Since the velocity is perpendicular to the field,
  $\sin \theta = 1$:
- $F = (1.60 \times 10^{-19})(2.0 \times 10^6)(0.50) = 1.60 \times 10^{-13}$ N
- **Radius of circular path:** Equate magnetic force to centripetal force:
- $qvB = \dfrac{mv^2}{r} \implies r = \dfrac{mv}{qB}$
- $r = \dfrac{(9.11 \times 10^{-31})(2.0 \times 10^6)}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19})(0.50)}$
- $r = \dfrac{1.82 \times 10^{-24}}{8.0 \times 10^{-20}} = 2.28 \times 10^{-5}$ m $= 22.8$ $\mu$M

</details>

### Worked Example: Faraday's Law and Induction (D.4)

A rectangular coil of 200 turns, each of area $0.040$ m$^2$Is placed in a uniform magnetic field.
The field strength decreases uniformly from $0.50$ T to $0.10$ T in $0.080$ s. Calculate the
magnitude Of the induced emf.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Rate of change of flux through one turn:**
- $\Delta \Phi = B_2 A - B_1 A = (0.10 - 0.50)(0.040) = -0.016$ Wb
- $\dfrac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{-0.016}{0.080} = -0.20$ Wb/s
- **Induced emf:** $\varepsilon = -N\dfrac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = -(200)(-0.20) = 40$ V
- By Lenz's law, the induced current flows in a direction that opposes the decrease in flux,
  creating additional flux through the coil in the same direction as the original field.

</details>

### Worked Example: Gravitational Potential and Escape Speed (D.1, HL)

Calculate the gravitational potential at a point $3.0 \times 10^7$ m from the centre of the Earth
And the escape speed from this altitude. ($M_E = 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg.)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Gravitational potential** (negative, zero at infinity):
- $V_g = -\dfrac{GM}{r} = -\dfrac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})}{3.0 \times 10^7}$
- $V_g = -\dfrac{3.98 \times 10^{14}}{3.0 \times 10^7} = -1.33 \times 10^7$ J/kg
- **Escape speed** (set total energy to zero: $\tfrac{1}{2}mv_{\mathrm{esc}}^2 + m V_g = 0$):
- $v_{\mathrm{esc}} = \sqrt{-2V_g} = \sqrt{2(1.33 \times 10^7)} = \sqrt{2.66 \times 10^7} = 5160$
  m/s

## Theme E: Nuclear and Quantum Physics

This theme introduces the quantum nature of matter and energy, covering nuclear physics, quantum
Phenomena, and the wave-particle duality of light and matter.

**SL content includes:**

- **E.1 Structure of the Atom:** The nuclear model; isotopes; mass defect and binding energy;
  nuclear fission and fusion.
- **E.2 Quantum Physics:** The photoelectric effect; photon energy and momentum; the de Broglie
  wavelength; wave-particle duality.

**AHL content includes:**

- **E.3 Radioactive Decay:** Exponential decay law; activity and half-life; decay series; background
  radiation.
- **E.4 Fission:** Chain reactions; critical mass; nuclear reactors; energy release in fission and
  fusion; binding energy per nucleon curve.

### Worked Example: Binding Energy per Nucleon (E.1)

Calculate the binding energy per nucleon of helium-4. Given: $m_p = 1.00728$ u, $m_n = 1.00867$ u,
$m_{\mathrm{He-4}} = 4.00150$ u, and $1$ u $= 931.5$ MeV/$c^2$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Helium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.**
- **Mass defect:** $\Delta m = 2m_p + 2m_n - m_{\mathrm{He-4}}$
- $\Delta m = 2(1.00728) + 2(1.00867) - 4.00150 = 2.01456 + 2.01734 - 4.00150 = 0.03040$ u
- **Binding energy:** $E_b = \Delta m \times 931.5 = 0.03040 \times 931.5 = 28.3$ MeV
- **Binding energy per nucleon:** $\dfrac{E_b}{A} = \dfrac{28.3}{4} = 7.08$ MeV/nucleon

</details>

### Worked Example: Photoelectric Effect (E.2)

Light of wavelength $450$ nm is incident on a zinc plate with a work function of $4.30$ eV.
Determine Whether photoelectrons are emitted, and if so, calculate their maximum kinetic energy in
eV. Use $h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s, $c = 3.00 \times 10^8$ m/s, $e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Energy of incident photon:**
- $E = \dfrac{hc}{\lambda} = \dfrac{(6.63 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{450 \times 10^{-9}}$
- $E = \dfrac{1.989 \times 10^{-25}}{4.50 \times 10^{-7}} = 4.42 \times 10^{-19}$ J
- $E = \dfrac{4.42 \times 10^{-19}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19}} = 2.76$ eV
- **Compare with work function:** Since $E = 2.76$ eV $\lt \phi = 4.30$ eV, the photon energy is
  insufficient. **No photoelectrons are emitted.**

</details>

### Worked Example: Radioactive Half-Life (E.3)

A sample of iodine-131 has an initial activity of $6400$ Bq. The half-life of iodine-131 is $8.04$
Days. Calculate (a) the activity after $32.2$ days, and (b) the time for the activity to fall to
$200$ Bq.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **(a) Activity after $32.2$ days:**
- Number of half-lives: $n = \dfrac{32.2}{8.04} = 4.00$
- $A = A_0 \times \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^n = 6400 \times \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^4 = 6400 \times \dfrac{1}{16} = 400$
  Bq
- **(b) Time for activity to reach 200 Bq:**
- $200 = 6400 \times \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^t / 8.04$
- $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^t / 8.04 = \dfrac{200}{6400} = \dfrac{1}{32} = \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^5$
- $\dfrac{t}{8.04} = 5 \implies t = 40.2$ days

</details>

### Worked Example: Nuclear Fission Energy (E.4, HL)

The nuclear reaction
$\;^{235}_{92}\mathrm{U} + ^{1}_{0}\mathrm{n} \rightarrow ^{141}_{56}\mathrm{Ba} + ^{92}_{36}\mathrm{Kr} + 3\,^{1}_{0}\mathrm{n}$
is a fission Event. Calculate the energy released. (Mass of $\;^{235}\mathrm{U} = 235.044$ u, Mass
of $\;^{141}\mathrm{Ba} = 140.914$ u, Mass of $\;^{92}\mathrm{Kr} = 91.926$ u, Mass of
$\;^{1}\mathrm{n} = 1.00867$ u, $1$ u $= 931.5$ MeV/$c^2$.)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Mass of reactants:**
- $m_{\mathrm{reactants}} = 235.044 + 1.00867 = 236.053$ u
- **Mass of products:**
- $m_{\mathrm{products}} = 140.914 + 91.926 + 3(1.00867) = 140.914 + 91.926 + 3.026 = 235.866$ u
- **Mass defect:**
- $\Delta m = 236.053 - 235.866 = 0.187$ u
- **Energy released:**
- $E = 0.187 \times 931.5 = 174$ MeV

This is a typical energy release per fission event of uranium-235.

</details>

### Worked Example: Electron Accelerated Through a Potential Difference (E.2)

An electron is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of $500$ V. Calculate the final
Speed of the electron and the electric field strength if the acceleration takes place over a
Distance of $0.050$ m.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Energy gained by the electron:**
- $E_k = e \Delta V = (1.60 \times 10^{-19})(500) = 8.0 \times 10^{-17}$ J
- **Final speed:**
- $\tfrac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = 8.0 \times 10^{-17}$
- $v = \sqrt{\dfrac{2(8.0 \times 10^{-17})}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{1.76 \times 10^{14}} = 1.33 \times 10^7$
  m/s
- **Electric field strength:**
- $E = \dfrac{\Delta V}{d} = \dfrac{500}{0.050} = 1.0 \times 10^4$ V/m

</details>

## SL vs HL Distinctions

The key differences between SL and HL are:

- **Depth of coverage:** HL students study approximately 60 hours of additional content (AHL) beyond
  the 80 hours of core SL material, totalling 150 hours compared to 110 hours at SL.
- **Mathematical rigour:** HL examinations demand a higher level of mathematical fluency, including
  more complex derivations and multi-step problems.
- **Paper 3:** Only HL students sit Paper 3, which assesses the AHL extension content through
  data-based and extended-response questions.
- **Practical work:** HL students are expected to complete a broader range of practical
  investigations, though the IA format is the same for both levels.

## Detailed Topic Breakdown

### Most-Tested Topics (by Exam Frequency)

Based on analysis of past IB Physics examinations, the following topics appear most frequently and
Carry significant marks:

1. **Mechanics (A.1--A.3):** Projectile motion, conservation of energy, momentum collisions,
   circular motion. Expect at least one major question in Paper 2.
2. **Thermal Physics (B.1--B.3, B.5):** Specific/latent heat calculations, ideal gas law, the first
   law of thermodynamics ($Q = \Delta U + W$), entropy. Multi-stage heating problems are a staple.
3. **Wave Phenomena (C.2--C.4):** Double-slit interference, single-slit diffraction, Snell's law,
   standing waves in strings and pipes. Tested with both conceptual and calculation questions.
4. **Fields (D.1--D.4):** Gravitational potential energy, electric field calculations, Faraday's law
   and Lenz's law. AHL students should expect a challenging induction problem.
5. **Quantum and Nuclear Physics (E.1--E.4):** Photoelectric effect, binding energy calculations,
   radioactive decay. The photoelectric equation $E_k = hf - \phi$ appears almost every year.

### Topic Weighting by Paper

| Paper        | Focus                     | Typical Question Style                                             |
| :----------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paper 1      | Breadth across all themes | Quick MCQ, ~1--2 min each, many formula-recall questions           |
| Paper 2      | Depth on core + AHL       | Multi-part structured questions, data analysis, 10--20 marks each  |
| Paper 3 (HL) | AHL content only          | Data-based question + extended response on D.5, E.3, E.4, B.5, B.7 |

## Study Strategies

### Spaced Revision Approach

A proven approach for IB Physics revision is to cycle through topics in increasing depth over
Several weeks:

1. **Weeks 1--4 (Foundation):** Read through all topic notes. Create a one-page formula summary per
   theme. Focus on understanding concepts, not memorising.
2. **Weeks 5--8 (Application):** Work through past paper questions topic by topic. Focus on the
   "Explain" and "Deduce" command terms. Identify weak areas.
3. **Weeks 9--12 (Exam Practice):** Complete full past papers under timed conditions. Focus on Paper
   2 Section B (extended response) and time management.
4. **Final 2 Weeks (Polish):** Review your formula summary sheets. Revisit only the questions you
   got wrong. Practise data booklet navigation.

### Mastering Command Terms

IB Physics exams use specific command terms that indicate the expected depth of response:

| Command Term  | What it Means                                                   |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Define**    | Give the precise meaning of a term                              |
| **Describe**  | Give a detailed account, including qualities or characteristics |
| **Explain**   | Give a detailed account of causes, reasons, or mechanisms       |
| **Deduce**    | Reach a conclusion from the information given                   |
| **Derive**    | Manipulate an equation to arrive at a new equation              |
| **Determine** | Find the only possible answer                                   |
| **Estimate**  | Find an approximate value                                       |
| **Justify**   | Give valid reasons or evidence to support an answer             |
| **Sketch**    | Draw approximately, showing key features (not to scale)         |
| **State**     | Give a specific name, value, or brief answer                    |

> **Exam Tip:** An "Explain" question requires a chain of reasoning with 2--3 linked statements. An
> answer that just states a formula will not earn full marks for "Explain."

### Common Pitfalls

- **Significant figures:** IB expects answers to be given to the same number of significant figures
  as the least precise data in the question ( 2--3 sf). Dropping to 1 sf or using 5+ sf will lose
  marks.
- **Units:** Every numerical answer must have a correct unit. Writing "15" instead of "15 J" will
  lose a mark, even if the calculation is correct.
- **Negative signs:** Particularly in thermodynamics ($Q$, $W$, $\Delta U$) and lens equations, sign
  conventions matter. Be consistent.
- **Showing work:** In Paper 2, method marks are awarded even if the final answer is wrong. Always
  show your working , including the formula you are using and substitution of values.

## Calculator Skills

The IB Physics exam allows a **GDC (Graphical Display Calculator)**. Proficiency with your
Calculator is essential.

### Recommended Calculators

| Calculator                               | Notes                                      |
| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Texas Instruments TI-84 Plus CE          | Most popular; widely supported             |
| Texas Instruments TI-Nspire CX (non-CAS) | More powerful; excellent for data analysis |
| Casio fx-CG50                            | Good alternative; colour display           |

**Note:** CAS (Computer Algebra System) calculators are **not permitted** in IB exams. Ensure your
Calculator mode is correct.

### Essential Calculator Skills for IB Physics

1. **Solving simultaneous equations:** Use the matrix solver or systems of equations function for
   circuit analysis (Kirchhoff's laws) and kinematic problems.
2. **Statistical analysis:** For the IA, you need to calculate mean, standard deviation, and
   uncertainty. Use the built-in statistics mode.
3. **Regression lines:** Linear regression ($y = mx + c$) for determining relationships from
   experimental data. Know how to find $r^2$ and interpret it.
4. **Converting units:** Practice converting between SI prefixes (nano, micro, milli, kilo, mega,
   giga) quickly.
5. **Scientific notation:** Ensure your calculator is in SCI mode so that very large or very small
   numbers are displayed properly.
6. **Storing values:** Use the STO function to store intermediate results with full precision,
   avoiding premature rounding.

### Worked Example: Calculator Efficiency

A problem requires calculating
$v = \sqrt{\frac{2(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})}{6.37 \times 10^6 + 3.5 \times 10^5}}$.

**Efficient approach:** Store the numerator and denominator separately:

- Numerator: $2 \times 6.67\mathrm{E}-11 \times 5.97\mathrm{E}24 \rightarrow$ STO A
- Denominator: $6.37\mathrm{E}6 + 3.5\mathrm{E}5 \rightarrow$ STO B
- Answer: $\sqrt{\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{B}}$

This avoids transcription errors and preserves precision.

> **Exam Tip:** In Paper 1 (no calculator allowed for SL; calculator allowed for HL), you must be
> comfortable with mental math and estimation. For Paper 2 and Paper 3, always check that your
> calculator answer has a reasonable order of magnitude.

## Exam Format and Time Management

### Paper 1: Multiple Choice

|                   | SL     | HL     |
| :---------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Duration          | 45 min | 60 min |
| Marks             | 30     | 40     |
| Time per question | ~90 s  | ~90 s  |

**Strategy:**

- Read the entire question and all four options before answering
- Eliminate wrong options first
- For calculation questions, estimate the answer to check if your calculation is reasonable
- Do not spend more than 2 minutes on any single question; flag and return if time permits
- There is **no negative marking** -- never leave a question blank

### Paper 2: Structured and Extended Response

|           | SL                                         | HL                                          |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Duration  | 1h 15min                                   | 2h 15min                                    |
| Section A | Data-based question + short response       | Data-based question + short response        |
| Section B | One extended response (from choice of two) | Two extended response (from choice of four) |

**Time management:**

- Section A: allocate ~30 min (SL) or ~60 min (HL)
- Section B: allocate ~45 min (SL) or ~75 min (HL)
- Within Section B, spend ~2--3 minutes reading and planning before writing
- Aim for 1 mark per minute as a rough guide

### Paper 3 (HL Only)

|           | HL                                                    |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Duration  | 1h                                                    |
| Section A | Data-based question on AHL content (practical skills) |
| Section B | Extended response from AHL topics                     |

**Strategy:**

- Section A tests experimental skills: uncertainty propagation, graph analysis, evaluating
  procedures
- Section B often combines multiple AHL topics in a single question
- Practise with past Paper 3 questions specifically -- the style is distinct from Paper 2

### Internal Assessment (IA)

- Individual investigation of your choice, assessed internally and moderated externally
- Maximum 3,000 words
- Worth 20% of the final grade (both SL and HL)
- Assessment criteria: Exploration (6), Analysis (6), Evaluation (6), Communication (4)
- Total: 22 marks

**IA tips:**

- Choose a topic with a clear independent and dependent variable
- Collect sufficient data (at least 5--7 data points with repeats)
- Show uncertainty calculations explicitly
- Include a thorough evaluation of systematic and random errors
- Do not choose an overly complex topic; a simple experiment done well scores higher than a complex
  one done poorly

### Data Booklet Tips

The physics data booklet is your most important tool in the exam. To use it effectively:

1. **Know the layout:** The booklet is organised by topic. Practise navigating it quickly -- do not
   waste exam time searching for a formula.
2. **Check units:** The booklet provides formulas but not always the units. Know the SI units for
   every quantity.
3. **Know what is NOT in the booklet:** Basic definitions, conceptual explanations, and many AHL
   formulas may need to be derived or memorised.
4. **Practise with it:** When doing past papers, always have the data booklet open. Never practise
   without it -- you need to build the habit of looking things up.
5. **Copy formulas correctly:** Transcription errors from the booklet are a major source of lost
   marks. Double-check that you have written the formula exactly as it appears.

## Problem Set

### Mechanics

1. A stone is dropped from a hot air balloon ascending at $5.00$ m/s. After $3.00$ s, what is the
   stone's velocity and displacement below the balloon? Take $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Velocity:** $v = u + at = 5.00 + (-9.81)(3.00) = 5.00 - 29.43 = -24.4$ m/s (downward)
- **Displacement relative to release point:**
  $s = ut + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2 = (5.00)(3.00) + \tfrac{1}{2}(-9.81)(3.00)^2$
- $s = 15.0 - 44.1 = -29.1$ m (29.1 m below release point)

If you get this wrong, revise: Kinematics -- SUVAT equations and sign conventions for
Upward/downward motion (Theme A.1).

</details>

2. A hockey puck of mass $0.170$ kg slides at $4.00$ m/s and is struck by a stick, receiving an
   impulse of $2.50$ N s in the direction of travel. Find its final speed.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Impulse-momentum theorem:** $J = \Delta p = m(v_f - v_i)$
- $2.50 = 0.170(v_f - 4.00)$
- $v_f - 4.00 = \dfrac{2.50}{0.170} = 14.71$
- $v_f = 18.7$ m/s

If you get this wrong, revise: Impulse and momentum, the impulse-momentum theorem (Theme A.2).

</details>

3. A roller coaster car of mass $500$ kg starts from rest at point A, $20.0$ m above the ground. It
   descends to point B at ground level and then rises to point C at $12.0$ m. A constant friction
   force of $200$ N acts over the total track length of $80.0$ m. Find the speed at point C.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Energy balance:** $mgh_A = mgh_C + \tfrac{1}{2}mv_C^2 + f \cdot d$
- $(500)(9.81)(20.0) = (500)(9.81)(12.0) + \tfrac{1}{2}(500)v_C^2 + (200)(80.0)$
- $98100 = 58860 + 250v_C^2 + 16000$
- $98100 - 58860 - 16000 = 250v_C^2$
- $23240 = 250v_C^2$
- $v_C = \sqrt{92.96} = 9.64$ m/s

If you get this wrong, revise: Conservation of energy with non-conservative forces (Theme A.3).

</details>

### Thermal Physics and Gases

4. An electric heater supplies $2.50$ kW of power to $0.800$ kg of water initially at $20.0$ degrees
   Celsius. How long does it take to bring the water to boiling point? ($c_{\mathrm{water}} = 4180$
   J/(kg K), ignore heat losses.)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Energy needed:** $Q = mc\Delta T = (0.800)(4180)(80.0) = 267520$ J
- **Time:** $P = \dfrac{Q}{t} \implies t = \dfrac{Q}{P} = \dfrac{267520}{2500} = 107$ s

If you get this wrong, revise: Specific heat capacity and power (Theme B.1).

</details>

5. A gas cylinder of volume $0.100$ m$^3$ contains gas at $300$ kPa and $300$ K. If the temperature
   is raised to $450$ K at constant volume, what is the new pressure?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Gay-Lussac's law (constant volume):** $\dfrac{P_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2}{T_2}$
- $P_2 = \dfrac{P_1 T_2}{T_1} = \dfrac{(300)(450)}{300} = 450$ kPa

If you get this wrong, revise: Gas laws and the ideal gas law (Theme B.3).

</details>

### Waves

6. A standing wave on a string of length $0.75$ m has a fundamental frequency of $220$ Hz. Find (a)
   the wave speed, and (b) the frequency of the second harmonic.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **(a) Wave speed:** For the fundamental, $L = \lambda/2$So $\lambda = 2L = 1.50$ m.
- $v = f\lambda = (220)(1.50) = 330$ m/s
- **(b) Second harmonic frequency:** $f_2 = 2f_1 = 2 \times 220 = 440$ Hz

If you get this wrong, revise: Standing waves and harmonics on strings (Theme C.5).

</details>

7. Light passes from air into a material with refractive index $1.60$ at an angle of incidence of
   $40.0$ degrees. Calculate the angle of refraction.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Snell's law:** $n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$
- $(1.00)\sin 40.0^\circ = (1.60)\sin \theta_2$
- $\sin \theta_2 = \dfrac{0.6428}{1.60} = 0.4017$
- $\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.4017) = 23.7$ degrees

If you get this wrong, revise: Snell's law and refraction (Theme C.3).

</details>

### Electricity and Circuits

8. A $6.0$ V battery with internal resistance $0.50$ ohms is connected to an external resistor of
   $11.5$ ohms. Calculate (a) the current, and (b) the terminal PD.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **(a) Current:**
  $I = \dfrac{\mathrm{emf}}{R_{\mathrm{ext}} + r} = \dfrac{6.0}{11.5 + 0.50} = \dfrac{6.0}{12.0} = 0.50$
  A
- **(b) Terminal PD:** $V = \mathrm{emf} - Ir = 6.0 - (0.50)(0.50) = 5.75$ V

If you get this wrong, revise: Internal resistance and terminal PD (Theme B.4).

</details>

### Fields

9. Two point charges, $q_1 = +3.0$ $\mu$C and $q_2 = -5.0$ $\mu$C, are placed $0.20$ m apart in
   vacuum. Calculate the force between them and state its nature.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Coulomb's law:** $F = \dfrac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2}$ where $k = 8.99 \times 10^9$ N m$^2$/C$^2$
- $F = \dfrac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(3.0 \times 10^{-6})(5.0 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.20)^2}$
- $F = \dfrac{(8.99 \times 10^9)(1.5 \times 10^{-11})}{0.040} = \dfrac{0.1349}{0.040} = 3.37$ N
- The force is **attractive** because the charges have opposite signs.

If you get this wrong, revise: Coulomb's law and electric forces (Theme D.2).

</details>

10. A satellite orbits Earth at a height of $500$ km above the surface. Calculate its orbital speed.
    Given: $M_{\mathrm{Earth}} = 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg, $R_{\mathrm{Earth}} = 6.37 \times 10^6$ m.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Orbital radius:** $r = 6.37 \times 10^6 + 5.00 \times 10^5 = 6.87 \times 10^6$ m
- **Equate gravitational force to centripetal force:** $\dfrac{GMm}{r^2} = \dfrac{mv^2}{r}$
- $v = \sqrt{\dfrac{GM}{r}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})}{6.87 \times 10^6}}$
- $v = \sqrt{\dfrac{3.982 \times 10^{14}}{6.87 \times 10^6}} = \sqrt{5.796 \times 10^7} = 7610$ m/s
  $= 7.61$ km/s

If you get this wrong, revise: Circular motion and gravitation, orbital mechanics (Theme B.6, D.1).

</details>

### Nuclear and Quantum Physics

11. The photoelectric effect is observed from a metal surface using light of frequency
    $8.0 \times 10^{14}$ Hz. The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is
    $1.2 \times 10^{-19}$ J. Calculate the work function of the metal in eV.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Photoelectric equation:** $E_k = hf - \phi$
- $\phi = hf - E_k = (6.63 \times 10^{-34})(8.0 \times 10^{14}) - 1.2 \times 10^{-19}$
- $\phi = 5.304 \times 10^{-19} - 1.2 \times 10^{-19} = 4.104 \times 10^{-19}$ J
- $\phi = \dfrac{4.104 \times 10^{-19}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19}} = 2.57$ eV

If you get this wrong, revise: The photoelectric effect and the equation $E_k = hf - \phi$ (Theme
E.2).

</details>

    $4.00 \times 10^{20}$ nuclei. How many nuclei remain after $15.81$ years?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Number of half-lives:** $n = \dfrac{15.81}{5.27} = 3.00$
- **Remaining nuclei:**
  $N = N_0 \times \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^n = 4.00 \times 10^{20} \times \dfrac{1}{8} = 5.00 \times 10^{19}$

If you get this wrong, revise: Exponential decay and half-life calculations (Theme E.3).

</details>

    Broglie wavelength of the electron. ($m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ kg, $e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19}$
    C, $h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s.)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Kinetic energy gained:** $E_k = e \Delta V = (1.60 \times 10^{-19})(250) = 4.00 \times 10^{-17}$
  J
- **Momentum:** $p = \sqrt{2 m_e E_k} = \sqrt{2(9.11 \times 10^{-31})(4.00 \times 10^{-17})}$
- $p = \sqrt{7.29 \times 10^{-47}} = 8.54 \times 10^{-24}$ kg m/s
- **de Broglie wavelength:**
  $\lambda = \dfrac{h}{p} = \dfrac{6.63 \times 10^{-34}}{8.54 \times 10^{-24}} = 7.76 \times 10^{-11}$
  m

This wavelength is comparable to atomic spacing, which is why electron diffraction can probe crystal
Structures.

    density $0.25$ T at a speed of $8.0$ m/s. The rod is part of a closed circuit with total
    resistance $5.0$ ohms. Calculate the induced emf and the current in the circuit.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Induced emf (motional emf):** $\varepsilon = BLv = (0.25)(0.40)(8.0) = 0.80$ V
- **Current:** $I = \dfrac{\varepsilon}{R} = \dfrac{0.80}{5.0} = 0.16$ A
- By Lenz's law, the induced current flows in a direction that creates a magnetic force opposing the
  motion of the rod.

If you get this wrong, revise: Faraday's law, motional emf, and Lenz's law (Theme D.4).

</details>

15. A monatomic ideal gas expands isobarically from $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$ to
    $5.0 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$ at a constant pressure of $1.5 \times 10^5$ Pa. During the process
    $600$ J of heat is supplied to the gas. Calculate the work done by the gas and the change in
    internal energy.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- **Work done by the gas at constant pressure:**
- $W = P \Delta V = (1.5 \times 10^5)(5.0 \times 10^{-3} - 2.0 \times 10^{-3})$
- $W = (1.5 \times 10^5)(3.0 \times 10^{-3}) = 450$ J
- **Change in internal energy (first law):** $\Delta U = Q - W = 600 - 450 = 150$ J

If you get this wrong, revise: First law of thermodynamics and thermodynamic processes (Theme B.5).

</details>

## Common Pitfalls

### Mechanics (Theme A)

- **Confusing velocity and speed:** Velocity is a vector; speed is its magnitude. A car rounding a
  bend at constant speed has changing velocity and therefore non-zero acceleration.
- **Projectile motion sign conventions:** Always define your positive direction at the start. Mixing
  up the sign of $g$ is the single most common error in kinematics problems.
- **Impulse-momentum sign errors:** Impulse $F \Delta t = \Delta p$. If a ball bounces off a wall,
  the change in momentum is $m(v_f - v_i)$ where $v_f$ and $v_i$ have opposite signs. Always account
  for direction when computing impulse.
- **Centripetal vs centrifugal:** There is no centrifugal force in an inertial frame. The net force
  towards the centre is the centripetal force -- it is not a separate force but the result of other
  forces (tension, gravity, friction, etc.).
- **Energy conservation with friction:** When friction is present, mechanical energy is not
  conserved. Always account for the work done by friction separately:
  $E_{k,i} + E_{p,i} = E_{k,f} + E_{p,f} + W_{\mathrm{friction}}$.
- **Power and efficiency:** Power is the rate of energy transfer ($P = W/t = Fv$). Efficiency is
  $\eta = \mathrm{useful\;output}/\mathrm{total\;input}$. Do not confuse power with energy or forget
  that efficiency is always less than 1 (or 100%).

### Thermal Physics (Theme B)

- **Mixing up specific heat and latent heat:** Specific heat ($Q = mc\Delta T$) applies during
  temperature changes; latent heat ($Q = mL$) applies during phase changes at constant temperature.
  Multi-stage heating problems require both.
- **First law sign convention:** $\Delta U = Q - W$. The IB convention defines $W$ as work done
  **by** the system. During compression, $W$ is negative and $\Delta U$ increases.
- **Ideal gas law units:** Pressure must be in pascals, volume in $\mathrm{m^3}$And temperature in
  kelvin. Never use Celsius in the ideal gas equation.
- **Internal resistance:** The terminal PD is always less than the emf when current flows:
  $V = \varepsilon - Ir$. Many students forget to subtract the internal potential drop.
- **Isothermal vs adiabatic:** In an isothermal process $\Delta T = 0$ and $\Delta U = 0$; in an
  adiabatic process $Q = 0$ so $\Delta U = -W$. Do not confuse the two.

### Waves (Theme C)

- **Fringe spacing formula:** $\Delta y = \lambda D / d$. Many students invert $d$ and $D$. Remember
  that increasing slit separation $d$ **decreases** fringe spacing.
- **Open vs closed pipe harmonics:** Open pipes produce all harmonics ($f_n = n f_1$); closed pipes
  produce only odd harmonics ($f_n = n f_1$ for odd $n$ only). The "second harmonic" does not exist
  in a closed pipe.
- **Standing wave nodes and antinodes:** At a closed end there is always a displacement node; at an
  open end there is always a displacement antinode.
- **Snell's law and TIR:** Total internal reflection can only occur when light travels from a
  higher-index medium to a lower-index medium. Always check this condition first.
- **Diffraction grating maximum order:** The maximum number of orders is limited by
  $\sin \theta \leq 1$Giving $n_{\max} = d/\lambda$. If this is not an integer, round down.
- **Single-slit vs double-slit:** Single-slit diffraction produces a broad central maximum with
  subsidiary maxima; double-slit interference produces equally spaced fringes modulated by the
  single-slit envelope. Do not confuse the two patterns.

### Fields (Theme D)

- **Gravitational field strength vs gravitational force:** $g = GM/r^2$ is field strength (per unit
  mass); $F = GMm/r^2$ is force on a specific mass. Do not multiply by $m$ twice.
- **Gravitational potential:** $V_g = -GM/r$ is always negative. It becomes less negative
  (increases) as $r$ increases, approaching zero at infinity. Many students incorrectly state that
  potential "decreases" with distance.
- **Electric potential is a scalar:** Unlike electric field (a vector), potential is a scalar. When
  multiple charges are present, add potentials algebraically, taking sign into account.
- **Lenz's law direction:** The induced current opposes the **change** in flux, not the flux itself.
  If flux is increasing, the induced current creates flux in the opposite direction.
- **Transformer equations:** $V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p$. Many students confuse primary and secondary. The
  side with more turns has the higher voltage.
- **Motional emf:** $\varepsilon = BLv$ requires the velocity to be perpendicular to the field. If
  the velocity is at an angle, use the perpendicular component only.

### Nuclear and Quantum Physics (Theme E)

- **Photoelectric effect threshold:** No electrons are emitted if $hf \lt \phi$Regardless of
  intensity. Increasing intensity only increases the number of photons, not their energy.
- **Mass defect sign:** The mass defect $\Delta m$ is always positive (mass of nucleus is always
  less than the sum of nucleon masses). Do not report a negative mass defect.
- **Binding energy per nucleon curve:** The most stable nuclei (like iron-56) are near the peak.
  Fusion is energetically favourable for light nuclei; fission is favourable for heavy nuclei.
- **Half-life calculations:** Remember that after $n$ half-lives, the fraction remaining is
  $(1/2)^n$Not $1/(2n)$. This is a very common arithmetic error.
- **de Broglie wavelength for massive particles:** The de Broglie equation applies to all matter,
  not just electrons. However, the wavelength is only significant for particles with very small mass
  (electrons, neutrons) -- for macroscopic objects it is negligibly small.
- **Activity vs count rate:** Activity $A$ is the number of decays per second in the sample; count
  rate is the number detected by a detector. Count rate is always less than activity due to detector
  efficiency and geometry. IB questions specify which is being asked.
