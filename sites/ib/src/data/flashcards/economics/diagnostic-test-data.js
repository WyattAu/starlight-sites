      'What happens to the equilibrium price and quantity of a good when demand increases and supply remains unchanged?',

    explanation:
      'An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right. The new intersection with the unchanged supply curve occurs at a higher price and higher quantity. Both equilibrium price and quantity increase.',

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'PED = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price. So % change in Qd = PED x % change in P = -0.3 x 10% = -3%. Quantity demanded falls by 3%. A PED magnitude less than 1 indicates inelastic demand.',

      'A homeowner maintaining a beautiful garden',
      'Workers gaining new skills through training',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      'A negative production externality occurs when a firm’s production imposes costs on third parties not involved in the transaction. Factory pollution affecting the river is a cost borne by the community, not the factory. The other options are positive externalities (consumption or production).',

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'If P = MC but MC > ATC, the firm is making a loss. However, it should shut down only if P < AVC. Since P >= MC > AVC is not necessarily true, but P = MC and MC > ATC means P > AVC (since AVC < ATC).

    explanation:
      'GDP (expenditure method) = C + I + G + (X - M). Government spending (G) on public services is included. Transfer payments are excluded as they are a redistribution of income, not spending on goods and services. Second-hand goods and financial transactions are also excluded as they do not represent current production.',

      'Reducing the money supply',
      'Increasing taxes on households',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'During a recession, expansionary fiscal policy aims to boost aggregate demand. Increasing government spending directly raises AD through the G component of GDP (C + I + G + X - M). This has a multiplier effect as the spending circulates through the economy. Increasing interest rates and taxes are contractionary policies.',

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Selling bonds withdraws money from the banking system as buyers pay the central bank. This reduces the money supply. With less money available for lending, the scarcity of funds pushes interest rates up. This is contractionary open market operations.',

    explanation:
      'Supply-side policies aim to increase productive capacity by improving the quality and quantity of factors of production. Investment in education and training improves labour productivity and human capital, shifting LRAS to the right. Minimum wage increases and higher taxes may reduce supply. Tariffs reduce competition and efficiency.',

      'Which trade policy restricts imports by placing a limit on the quantity of a good that can enter a country?',
    options: ['Tariff', 'Quota', 'Subsidy', 'Embargo'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'A quota is a physical limit on the quantity or value of a good that can be imported over a given period. Unlike a tariff (which is a tax on imports), a quota directly restricts the volume of imports. An embargo is a complete ban, and a subsidy supports domestic producers rather than restricting imports.',

      'No effect on the exchange rate',
      'Both currencies depreciate equally',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "Higher inflation in Country A makes its goods more expensive relative to Country B’s, reducing demand for Country A\'s exports and its currency. According to purchasing power parity (PPP), the currency of the higher-inflation country depreciates to restore equilibrium in the long run.",

      'A country has a persistent current account deficit. Which of the following would worsen this deficit?',
    options: [
      'A depreciation of the domestic currency',
      'An increase in domestic savings',
      'A decrease in government spending',
      'An appreciation of the domestic currency',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation:
      'Currency appreciation makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, worsening the current account deficit. Depreciation would improve it (assuming Marshall-Lerner conditions are met). Higher domestic savings and lower government spending reduce domestic absorption, which would improve the current account.',

    question: 'What is comparative advantage?',
    options: [
      'A country can produce a good using fewer resources than another country',
      'A country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country',
      'A country has a higher productivity in all goods compared to another country',
      'A country can produce more of a good than any other country',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Comparative advantage refers to producing a good at a lower opportunity cost, not necessarily using fewer resources (which is absolute advantage). Even if one country is more efficient at producing everything, both countries can benefit from trade by specialising in goods where their opportunity cost is lowest.',

      'Which indicator is most commonly used to measure a country’s level of economic development?',
    options: ['GDP per capita', 'Total GDP', 'Population size', 'Exchange rate'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      'GDP per capita (GDP divided by population) is the most commonly used single indicator of development as it reflects average income and living standards. Total GDP does not account for population differences. GDP per capita has limitations (it does not measure inequality, health, or education), which is why composite indices like HDI also exist.',

      'Weak institutions and corruption',
      'High levels of literacy',
      'Access to international trade',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Weak institutions and corruption are widely regarded as major barriers to growth in developing countries. Corruption discourages investment, distorts resource allocation, and undermines the rule of law. Foreign direct investment, literacy, and trade access generally support growth rather than hinder it.',

    question: 'What is the poverty trap cycle?',
    options: [
      'High incomes lead to higher taxes, which reduce economic growth',
      'Low income leads to low savings, low investment, low productivity, and thus low income in a self-reinforcing cycle',
      'Foreign aid creates dependency, reducing domestic production',
      'Rapid population growth leads to environmental degradation and lower GDP',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'The poverty trap describes a self-reinforcing cycle where low income leads to low savings, which limits investment in physical and human capital, resulting in low productivity and continued low income. Breaking this cycle often requires external intervention such as aid, investment, or institutional reform to generate initial growth.',

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Mean = sum of values / number of values = (4 + 8 + 6 + 10 + 2) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. The mean is the arithmetic average, calculated by adding all values and dividing by the count.',

    options: ['10%', '12%', '132%', '8%'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      'Inflation rate = ((new index - old index) / old index) x 100 = ((132 - 120) / 120) x 100 = (12 / 120) x 100 = 10%. The index itself is not the inflation rate; the percentage change in the index measures inflation.',

      'A worker earned $20,000 in year 1 and $22,000 in year 2. If the CPI was 100 in year 1 and 108 in year 2, what happened to their real income?',
    options: [

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Real income in year 1 = $20,000 / 100 x 100 = $20,000. Real income in year 2 = $22,000 / 108 x 100 = $20,370.37. The nominal increase is 10%, but real income increased by only ($20,370.37 - $20,000) / $20,000 = 1.85%, approximately 1.9%.',

    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'In the classic prisoner’s dilemma, each player has a dominant strategy to defect (confess). Regardless of what the other player does, defecting yields a better outcome: if the other cooperates, defecting gives a lighter sentence; if the other defects, defecting avoids the harshest penalty. This leads to a Nash equilibrium where both defect, even though mutual cooperation would yield a better collective outcome.',

    options: ['Loss aversion', 'Status quo bias', 'Anchoring', 'Confirmation bias'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Status quo bias is the preference for the current state of affairs. Consumers stick with default options or existing choices because the potential losses from change feel greater than the potential gains. Loss aversion is related but refers to losses being weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, while anchoring refers to over-relying on the first piece of information encountered.',
