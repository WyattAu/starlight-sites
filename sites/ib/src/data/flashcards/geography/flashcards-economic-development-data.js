GNI is preferred for development comparisons because it better reflects the actual income of a country's residents. For example: the Philippines has significant overseas workers whose remittances are captured in GNI but not GDP; oil-rich Gulf states have high GDP but much of the income flows to foreign workers and corporations, so GNI per capita is a more accurate measure of citizens' wealth.",

(2) It is not solely focused on growth; a country could have a high GNH without high GDP. (3) It is qualitative and subjective in parts. Criticisms: difficult to measure objectively and compare internationally; Bhutan is a small, culturally homogeneous country; the concept may not be readily transferable to large, diverse nations.

Debt is considered sustainable when the net present value of debt-to-export ratio is below 150% or debt-to-revenue ratio is below 250%. By 2020, 36 countries received $76 billion in debt relief.

Impact: post-HIPC countries have increased health and education spending (e.g. Mozambique increased education spending by 75% after debt relief).

Key success factors: initial low labour costs, government industrial policy (subsidies, SEZs), investment in education and infrastructure, and access to US/EU markets.
