But checking: s₁ = 0(2) + ½(4)(4) = 8 m  (verified). s₂ (for 2-4s): s₂ = 4(2) + ½(4)(4) − 8 = 8 + 8 − 8 = 8 m. Total by 4s: 8 + 8 = 16. This doesn't match 32.

Second: 32 = 4u + 8a → u + 2a = 8. a = 4, u = 0. The answer is u = 0 m s⁻¹, but wait:\nu + a = 4 means u = 4 − a = 0. The first segment gives 8 m with u=0, a=4, t=2: s = 0 + ½(4)(4) = 8\n (verified). Closest option A gives u=1: 2(1)+½a(4)=8 → a=3. At t=4: 4(1)+½(3)(16)=4+24=28, not 32. So u=0,\noption D.",
