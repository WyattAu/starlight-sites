Information flows from sensory to STM via attention, and from STM to LTM via rehearsal. Support: Sperling (1960) demonstrated sensory memory; Peterson and Peterson (1959) showed STM duration without rehearsal. Criticism: the model is oversimplified and does not account for different types of LTM.',

Shallow processing involves structural or phonetic analysis (e.g., checking if a word is in capital letters). Deep processing involves semantic analysis (e.g., considering the meaning of a word). Deeper processing leads to better recall because it creates more durable memory traces. Craik and Tulving (1975) found that words processed semantically had the highest recall rates. Unlike the multi-store model, this theory does not distinguish between STM and LTM as separate stores.',

Longer words take more time to articulate, so fewer can be rehearsed within this time window. Baddeley et al.
