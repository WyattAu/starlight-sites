## Abstract

Hardware tuning reference covering undervolting, overclocking, memory tuning, stress testing
Methodology, and platform-specific considerations for Intel, AMD, and Apple Silicon.

## What Is Hardware Tuning

Hardware tuning is the practice of adjusting system parameters beyond their factory defaults to
Extract more performance, improve efficiency, or reduce noise. The three primary disciplines are:

- **Undervolting** — reducing the supply voltage to a component (CPU, GPU, SoC) below the
  manufacturer's default while maintaining the same clock frequencies. Because power dissipation
  scales with the square of voltage ($P \propto V^2$), even modest voltage reductions yield
  significant thermal and power savings. This is the single most impactful and lowest-risk tuning
  technique available on modern hardware.

- **Overclocking** — increasing clock frequencies, bus speeds, or power limits beyond stock values.
  This can be applied to CPUs, GPUs, memory, and sometimes the system agent / ring bus. Gains are
  real but come at the cost of higher power draw, higher temperatures, and reduced silicon
  longevity.

- **Memory Tuning** — tightening timings, increasing data rates, or adjusting memory controller
  parameters (fabric clock on AMD, Gear mode on Intel). Memory bandwidth and latency directly affect
  frame rates, compile times, and memory-bound workloads.

These techniques are not mutually exclusive. A common approach is to undervolt the CPU for thermal
Headroom, then use that headroom to sustain higher boost clocks for longer durations — effectively a
"free" performance uplift.

## Why People Tune Hardware

### Performance

Modern silicon is binned conservatively. A chip rated for 5.0 GHz may be capable of 5.2 GHz, or the
Same 5.0 GHz at 50 mV less. The silicon lottery means two identical SKUs can behave differently.
Tuning lets you reclaim the margin the manufacturer left for worst-case scenarios and batch
Variance.

### Efficiency

Undervolting is the most compelling reason to tune for laptops and small-form-factor builds. A 100
MV reduction on a 65 W CPU can shave 8–12 W off the package power, which translates directly to
Longer battery life, lower fan noise, and a cooler chassis. On desktops, the same reduction means
Your cooling solution lasts longer and your power bill is marginally lower.

### Noise Reduction

Lower voltage means lower heat, which means fans spin slower. In a quiet office or home theater
Environment, the difference between a CPU at 85 °C with fans at 2000 RPM versus 65 °C with fans at
1200 RPM is dramatic. Undervolting alone can often eliminate the need for aggressive fan curves.

### Learning

Hardware tuning teaches you how modern processors work — how turbo boost algorithms function, what
Load-Line Calibration does, how memory timings interact. For systems engineers, this knowledge is
Directly transferable to power management in data centers and embedded systems.

## Risk Assessment

| Technique           | Performance Gain           | Thermal Impact            | Risk Level  | Reversibility                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| CPU Undervolting    | 0–5% (sustained)           | Large reduction           | Low         | Fully reversible              |
| GPU Undervolting    | 0–10% (sustained)          | Large reduction           | Low         | Fully reversible              |
| CPU Overclocking    | 5–30%                      | Large increase            | Medium–High | Fully reversible (reset CMOS) |
| GPU Overclocking    | 5–15%                      | Moderate increase         | Medium      | Fully reversible              |
| Memory Overclocking | 3–15% (workload-dependent) | Moderate increase         | Medium      | Fully reversible              |
| BCLK Overclocking   | Variable                   | Can affect all components | High        | Fully reversible              |

**Important:** "Fully reversible" means you can restore stock settings. It does not mean there is
Zero risk of data corruption during instability. Always save your work before stress testing.

## Tools Overview

### Monitoring

- **HWiNFO64** — The gold standard for hardware monitoring on Windows. Reports per-core
  temperatures, package power, VID, Vcore, DRAM voltage, fan speeds, and WHEA errors. Use the
  "Sensors Only" mode and enable logging during stress tests. This tool is essential and should be
  running whenever you are tuning.

- **CoreTemp** — Lightweight per-core temperature monitor. Less comprehensive than HWiNFO64 but
  useful for quick checks.

- **MSI Afterburner / RivaTuner** — GPU monitoring and on-screen display (OSD) overlay. Shows GPU
  clock, memory clock, temperature, power draw, and frame rates in real time.

### CPU Tuning (Intel)

- **ThrottleStop** — The preferred tool for Intel undervolting on laptops. Supports "FIVR" (Fully
  Integrated Voltage Regulator) offset undervolting per core type (P-cores, E-cores). Can also
  disable speed shift, set power limits, and configure turbo boost power windows. Works even when
  OEM BIOS locks voltage control.

- **Intel XTU (Extreme Tuning Utility)** — Desktop-focused counterpart to ThrottleStop. Provides a
  GUI for adjusting multipliers, voltages, power limits, and memory timings. Less useful on recent
  platforms where Intel has locked voltage control at the software level.

- **Intel Power Gadget** — Simple tool for monitoring package power and frequency. Useful for quick
  checks but not a substitute for HWiNFO64.

### CPU Tuning (AMD)

- **AMD Ryzen Master** — Official AMD tuning utility. Supports Curve Optimizer (per-core or all-core
  undervolting), PPT/TDC/EDC limit adjustment, memory timing changes, and manual frequency control.
  Changes can be saved as profiles that persist across reboots.

- **ZenTimings** — Third-party tool for reading and adjusting AMD memory timings without entering
  BIOS.

### GPU Tuning

- **MSI Afterburner** — Universal GPU overclocking and undervolting tool. Works with NVIDIA and AMD
  GPUs regardless of board partner. Supports voltage/frequency curve editing, custom fan curves,
  power limit adjustments, and monitoring OSD.

- **NVIDIA Profile Inspector** — Deep-dive tool for NVIDIA GPU settings that are not exposed in the
  control panel, including power management modes and clock offset persistence.

### Stress Testing

- **Prime95** — The standard for CPU stability testing. The Small FFTs test generates maximum heat
  and is ideal for thermal testing. Blend test stresses both CPU and memory. Run for at least 1–2
  hours; overnight for production systems.

- **OCCT** — Comprehensive stability tester with CPU, memory, GPU, and power supply tests. The OCCT
  CPU test is particularly good at catching instability that Prime95 misses.

- **Cinebench R23 / Cinebench 2024** — Quick benchmark for smoke testing. Run multi-core after any
  voltage change. If it crashes, you need more voltage.

- **y-cruncher** — Compute-intensive stress test that exercises the CPU differently from Prime95.
  The "VST" (Variable Size Transform) test is recommended for stability verification. Run for at
  least 15–30 minutes.

- **MemTest86** — Bootable memory tester. Run at least 4 passes after any memory timing or frequency
  change. No operating system involved, so it tests memory in isolation.

- **FurMark / Superposition** — GPU stress tests. FurMark is a power virus; use it to verify GPU
  thermal limits. Superposition provides a more realistic gaming workload.

## Safety Guidelines

1. **Update your BIOS/UEFI first.** Manufacturers frequently release updates that improve stability,
   add tuning options, or fix bugs that affect power delivery.

2. **Backup your BIOS profile.** Most modern BIOS implementations allow you to save and export
   profiles. Do this before making any changes.

3. **Change one variable at a time.** If you adjust voltage and frequency simultaneously and the
   system becomes unstable, you will not know which change caused the problem.

4. **Monitor temperatures constantly.** Modern CPUs begin thermal throttling around 95–100 °C.
   Sustained operation above 90 °C is not recommended for longevity. AMD's junction temperature
   limit (Tjmax) is 95 °C; Intel's is 100 °C.

5. **Check for WHEA errors.** Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA) errors indicate that the
   CPU detected and corrected internal errors. Even if the system appears stable, WHEA errors mean
   your settings are too aggressive. HWiNFO64 can log these.

6. **Know how to clear CMOS.** If your system fails to boot after a BIOS change, you need to reset
   to defaults. This is done by:

- Powering off the system completely
- Removing the CMOS battery for 60 seconds, or
- Shorting the JBAT1 header with a screwdriver for 5 seconds

7. **Save your work before stress testing.** Instability can cause system freezes, BSODs, or
   spontaneous reboots. Any unsaved work will be lost.

8. **Do not tune on a mission-critical machine.** Use a test system or be prepared to restore from
   backup. Tuning should be done on systems where you can tolerate downtime.

## When NOT to Tune

- **You do not have a backup strategy.** Data loss from instability is real. If you do not have
  regular backups, address that before tuning.

- **Your system is already thermally constrained.** If your CPU is hitting 100 °C at stock settings,
  your cooling solution is inadequate. Tuning will not fix a cooling problem. Upgrade your thermal
  solution first.

- **You are tuning a work laptop managed by IT.** Enterprise policies may prevent or prohibit
  modifications. You also risk voiding warranty or support agreements.

- **Your hardware is under warranty and you want to keep it.** Aggressive overclocking can degrade
  silicon over time. If you need to make a warranty claim, the manufacturer may refuse if they
  detect non-default settings (Intel ME logs, for example, can record certain parameters).

- **You are experiencing random crashes at stock settings.** If your system is unstable at defaults,
  you have a hardware problem (bad RAM, failing PSU, inadequate cooling, or a defective CPU). Tuning
  will not fix this — it will make it worse. Diagnose and fix the underlying issue first.

- **You are not comfortable with BIOS settings.** If you do not understand what Load-Line
  Calibration, Vdroop, or PPT limits are, read the documentation for your specific platform before
  making changes. Incorrect settings can cause data corruption even if the system appears to boot
  normally.

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Intel (12th Gen and Later)

Intel has progressively locked down undervolting options. On 12th and 13th Gen desktop platforms,
ThrottleStop and XTU undervolting may be blocked by microcode updates. 14th Gen desktop CPUs
Generally retain some undervolting capability. Laptop platforms vary by OEM — some lock voltage
Control entirely, others allow it.

### AMD (Zen 3 and Later)

AMD's Curve Optimizer is the primary undervolting mechanism. It adjusts the voltage-frequency curve
With a negative offset per core. This is platform-controlled and works within the boost algorithm,
Making it safer than fixed offset undervolting. PPT (Package Power Tracking), TDC (Thermal Design
Current), and EDC (Electrical Design Current) limits can also be adjusted for power-constrained
Scenarios.

### Apple Silicon

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4 series) does not expose tuning controls to the user. The power management
Is handled entirely by the OS and firmware. You cannot undervolt or overclock Apple Silicon.

## Terminology

- **Vcore** — The core voltage supplied to the CPU. Measured in volts (V). Typical values range from
  0.7 V at idle to 1.3–1.4 V under load on modern CPUs.

- **VID (Voltage ID)** — The voltage requested by the CPU from the voltage regulator. The actual
  delivered voltage (Vcore) may differ due to Vdroop and LLC settings.

- **Vdroop** — The intentional reduction in voltage under load to prevent transient voltage spikes
  when the load suddenly decreases. Without Vdroop, a rapid drop in CPU load could cause the voltage
  to overshoot and damage the silicon.

- **LLC (Load-Line Calibration)** — A BIOS setting that counteracts Vdroop. Higher LLC levels
  deliver voltage closer to the VID under load, but increase the risk of voltage overshoot on load
  transitions. Level 4 or 5 (on a 1–7 scale) is recommended for overclocking.

- **PPT/TDC/EDC** — AMD-specific power limits. PPT is the total package power in watts. TDC is the
  sustained current limit. EDC is the peak/turbo current limit. Adjusting these controls how much
  power the CPU is allowed to draw.

- **PL1/PL2** — Intel-specific power limits. PL1 is the sustained power limit. PL2 is the short-
  duration turbo power limit ( 2.5x PL1 for 28 seconds on desktop).

- **Silicon Lottery** — The natural variance in silicon quality between individual chips of the same
  model. Some chips overclock better, undervolt further, or run cooler than others.

- **Binning** — The process by which manufacturers test and classify chips. Higher-binned chips are
  sold as faster SKUs. Lower-binned chips are sold as slower SKUs or with locked multipliers.

- **Thermal Throttling** — Automatic reduction of clock speed to maintain safe operating
  temperatures. Not harmful, but indicates your cooling solution is at its limit.

- **WHEA Errors** — Windows Hardware Error Architecture errors. Logged when the CPU detects and
  corrects internal errors. Even corrected errors indicate instability and should not be ignored.
