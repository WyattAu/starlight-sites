## Why Go

Go was designed at Google by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer, first released in 2009.
It targets the niche between systems languages (C, C++) and managed languages (Java, Python): fast
Compilation, native performance, garbage collection, and built-in concurrency primitives.

Core design goals:

1. **Simplicity.** The language spec is ~50 pages. There are no exceptions, no inheritance, no
   operator overloading, no macros. Features are additive, not combinatorial -- the number of
   concepts you must hold in your head grows linearly with the language, not exponentially.

2. **Fast compilation.** Dependency-aware compilation, minimal syntax, and no header files mean
   large codebases compile in seconds, not minutes.

3. **Concurrency as a first-class citizen.** Goroutines are multiplexed onto OS threads by the
   runtime scheduler. Channels provide safe communication between goroutines without locks.

4. **Static typing with inference.** Types are checked at compile time, but the compiler infers
   types where unambiguous. This catches bugs early without the verbosity of explicit annotations
   everywhere.

## Compilation Model

Go compiles to native machine code. There is no VM, no interpreter, no JIT.

```
Source (.go) -> go build -> linker -> native binary (statically linked by default)
```

The compiler pipeline:

- **Lexing and parsing** -> AST
- **Type checking** -> resolves all types, verifies correctness
- **SSA-based optimization** -> intermediate representation for optimizations
- **Machine code generation** -> targets the native architecture

The resulting binary is statically linked by default (on Linux/macOS), containing the Go runtime,
Garbage collector, and all dependencies. No external shared libraries are required at runtime.

## Installation

Download from [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) or use a package manager:

```bash
# Linux (snap)
sudo snap install go --classic

# macOS (homebrew)
brew install go

# Verify
go version
```

Set up workspace environment variables:

```bash
# GOPATH is where Go stores downloaded modules and built binaries
# Default is $HOME/go
go env GOPATH

# GOROOT is where Go is installed (usually auto-detected)
go env GOROOT
```

## Hello World

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Run directly:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Build a binary:

```bash
go build -o hello main.go
./hello
```

Every Go file belongs to a package. Executables must be in `package main` and expose a
`func main()`. Library packages use any other name and are imported by path.

## The Go Toolchain

### `go run`

Compiles and executes one or more `.go` files in a temporary directory. Useful for development and
One-off scripts. Does not produce a persistent binary.

```bash
go run .
go run main.go
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### `go build`

Compiles packages and dependencies, producing a binary. By default, the binary is named after the
Directory containing `package main`.

```bash
go build                  # binary named after current directory
go build -o myapp        # custom output name
go build -ldflags "-s -w" # strip debug info, reduce binary size
go build -race            # enable race detector
```

Cross-compilation is trivial -- set `GOOS` and `GOARCH`:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-linux
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp.exe
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o myapp-mac
```

### `go install`

Builds and installs the binary to `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$GOBIN` if set). This is how CLI tools are
Installed from source.

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

### `go fmt` / `gofmt`

Formats Go source code according to the standard style. There is no configuration -- the format is
Canonical. This eliminates style debates in code reviews.

```bash
go fmt ./...
```

### `go vet`

Examines source code and reports suspicious constructs. Catches bugs that the compiler does not.

```bash
go vet ./...
```

### `go doc`

Prints documentation for packages and symbols.

```bash
go doc fmt.Println
go doc net/http
```

## Project Structure

A minimal Go project:

```
myproject/
  go.mod
  main.go
  internal/
    db/
      db.go
  cmd/
    server/
      main.go
```

The `internal/` directory is special: packages inside `internal` cannot be imported by packages
Outside the module tree rooted at the parent of `internal`. This enforces encapsulation.

The `cmd/` directory convention holds executable entry points.

## Go Modules

Since Go 1.16, modules are the default dependency management system. A `go.mod` file declares the
Module path and dependency requirements:

```go
module github.com/you/myproject

go 1.22

require (
    github.com/go-chi/chi/v5 v5.0.12
    github.com/lib/pq v1.10.9
)
```

Key module commands:

```bash
go mod init github.com/you/myproject   # initialize
go mod tidy                             # sync dependencies with source
go mod download                          # download modules to cache
go mod verify                            # verify checksums
go mod graph                             # print dependency graph
go list -m all                           # list all dependencies
```

`go.sum` records the expected cryptographic checksums of every dependency. It should be committed to
Version control and never edited manually.

## Where Go Runs

| Target                               | Use Case                   |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Linux** (amd64, arm64)             | Servers, containers, cloud |
| **macOS** (amd64, arm64)             | Desktop development        |
| **Windows** (amd64)                  | Desktop applications       |
| **WebAssembly** (wasm)               | Browser, edge computing    |
| **FreeBSD/OpenBSD**                  | Networking, infrastructure |
| **Embedded** (GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm) | IoT, routers, ARM devices  |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Not setting `GOPATH`/`GOBIN` on `$PATH`.** `go install` places binaries in `$GOPATH/bin` or
   `$GOBIN`. If this is not on your PATH, installed tools will not be found.

2. **Using `go run` in production.** `go run` compiles to a temp directory and does not produce an
   artifact. Use `go build` to produce a deployable binary.

3. **Ignoring `go vet`.** Run `go vet ./...` before every commit. It catches real bugs: unreachable
   code, incorrect format strings, lock copies, and more.

4. **Not committing `go.sum`.** The `go.sum` file is essential for reproducible builds. Always
   commit it alongside `go.mod`.

5. **Using `latest` in `go install` without pinning.** `go install tool@latest` always fetches the
   newest version. Pin versions in `go.mod` for reproducible builds.

6. **Circular imports.** Go does not allow circular imports between packages. If A imports B and B
   imports A, the compiler rejects it. Restructure by extracting the shared code into a third
   package.

## Intuition

Go is the language of simplicity at scale. It was designed at Google to solve the problem of large codebases with many contributors: fast compilation, clear syntax, and built-in concurrency. Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, and channels are the pipes that connect them. Go intentionally omits features like inheritance, generics (until 1.18), and exceptions, favouring composition, error values, and explicit error handling. The result is code that looks similar across teams and projects.
