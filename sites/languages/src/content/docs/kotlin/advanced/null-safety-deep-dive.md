## Nullable Types

Kotlin's type system distinguishes between nullable and non-null types at compile time:

```kotlin
var name: String = "Alice"       // non-null: cannot hold null
var nickname: String? = null    // nullable: can hold null or a String
```

Assigning `null` to a non-null type is a compile-time error:

```kotlin
name = null  // compile error: Null can not be a value of a non-null type String
```

Non-null types are the default. The `?` suffix makes a type nullable. The compiler enforces this
distinction throughout — you cannot pass a nullable `String?` where `String` is expected without
explicit handling.

## Safe Calls and Elvis

### Safe Call Operator (?.)

The safe call operator returns the value if the receiver is non-null, or `null` if the receiver is
null. The entire chain short-circuits:

```kotlin
val length: Int? = name?.length        // null-safe access
val city: String? = user?.address?.city  // chains short-circuit
```

No `NullPointerException` at runtime — the compiler inserts null checks.

### Elvis Operator (?:)

The elvis operator provides a default value when the left side is null:

```kotlin
val displayName: String = name ?: "Anonymous"
val len: Int = name?.length ?: 0
```

It is equivalent to:

```kotlin
val displayName = if (name != null) name else "Anonymous"
```

### let Scope

`let` executes a block only when the receiver is non-null. Inside the block, `it` is the non-null
unwrapped value:

```kotlin
name?.let {
    println("Name is ${it.uppercase()}")  // it: String (non-null)
    println("Length: ${it.length}")        // safe to access length
}
```

With explicit name:

```kotlin
name?.let { n ->
    println("Name is $n")
}
```

Common pattern for early returns:

```kotlin
fun process(user: User?) {
    val email = user?.email ?: return
    sendEmail(email)
}
```

## Not-Null Assertions

### !! Operator

The `!!` operator asserts that a value is non-null. If it is null, a `KotlinNullPointerException` is
thrown at runtime:

```kotlin
val name: String? = getName()
val len: Int = name!!.length  // throws NPE if name is null
```

### When to Use

Use `!!` only when you are **certain** the value is non-null and no better alternative exists:

```kotlin
// Acceptable: precondition known to hold
val result = list.first()!!.someMethod()

// Better: avoid !! with safe alternatives
val result = list.firstOrNull()?.someMethod()
```

### When to Avoid

Prefer `!!` alternatives in most cases:

```kotlin
// Instead of: val len = name!!.length
// Use:
val len = name?.length ?: throw IllegalStateException("name is required")
val len = requireNotNull(name) { "name is required" }.length
val len = name!!.length  // only when you truly guarantee non-null
```

`requireNotNull` provides a descriptive error message, unlike `!!` which gives a generic NPE.

## Null Safety and Java Interop

### Platform Types

When calling Java code, Kotlin does not know whether a value can be null. Such types are called
**platform types** and represented as `String!` (in the IDE). The compiler allows both nullable and
non-null usage:

```java
// Java
public String getName() { return null; }
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin — both compile, but one may NPE at runtime
val name: String = getName()   // risky: may NPE
val name: String? = getName()  // safe: treat as nullable
```

### @Nullable and @NotNull Annotations

Annotate Java APIs to help Kotlin's compiler:

```java
import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull;
import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;

@NotNull
public String getName() { return name; }

@Nullable
public String getNickname() { return nickname; }
```

Supported annotation packages:

- `org.jetbrains.annotations` (JetBrains)
- `javax.annotation` (JSR-305)
- `androidx.annotation` (Android)
- `lombok.NonNull` (Lombok)

Without annotations, Kotlin assumes the worst — the value could be null.

## Contracts

### Smart Casts After Null Checks

Kotlin performs **smart casts** after null checks:

```kotlin
val name: String? = getName()

if (name != null) {
    println(name.length)  // name is smart-cast to String (non-null)
}
```

The compiler tracks null-check flow and automatically casts inside the safe branch.

### Compiler Contracts

Contracts tell the compiler about function behaviour. The standard library uses them internally:

```kotlin
public inline fun <T> T?.let(block: (T) -> R): R {
    contract { returns() implies (this@let != null) }
    return block(this)
}
```

`returns() implies (this@let != null)` tells the compiler: after `let` returns, the receiver is
non-null. This is why smart casts work inside `let`.

Custom contracts:

```kotlin
fun String?.requireNonEmpty(): String {
    contract { returns() implies (this@requireNonEmpty != null) }
    require(!this.isNullOrEmpty()) { "string must be non-empty" }
    return this!!
}
```

### Limitations

Contracts have limitations:

- They only work with `inline` functions.
- They cannot express complex relationships (e.g., "if the function returns false, then the
  parameter is null").
- `contract` blocks are experimental in some compiler versions.

## Collections and Null

### emptyList() vs listOf(null)

```kotlin
val empty: List<String> = emptyList()       // empty, non-null list
val withNull: List<String?> = listOf(null)   // list with one null element
val mixed: List<String?> = listOf("a", null, "b")
```

`emptyList<String>()` is an empty list of non-null strings. `listOf(null)` is a list of nullable
strings containing one element.

### filterNotNull

Removes null elements and returns a `List<T>` (non-null):

```kotlin
val items: List<String?> = listOf("hello", null, "world")
val nonNull: List<String> = items.filterNotNull()  // ["hello", "world"]
```

### mapNotNull

Maps and filters in one pass — drops entries where the transform returns null:

```kotlin
val names: List<String> = users.mapNotNull { it.name }
// equivalent to: users.map { it.name }.filterNotNull()
```

### Map with Nullable Values

```kotlin
val map: Map<String, String?> = mapOf(
    "name" to "Alice",
    "nickname" to null,
)
val name: String? = map["name"]
```

## Sealed Classes and When

### Exhaustive When with Sealed Classes

Sealed classes restrict inheritance to a known set of subclasses. `when` used as an expression must
be exhaustive:

```kotlin
sealed class Result {
    data class Success(val data: String) : Result()
    data class Error(val message: String) : Result()
    object Loading : Result()
}

fun describe(result: Result): String = when (result) {
    is Result.Success -> "Data: ${result.data}"
    is Result.Error -> "Error: ${result.message}"
    Result.Loading -> "Loading..."
    // no else needed — exhaustive
}
```

### Handling Null Branches

When a sealed class property is nullable, include the null check:

```kotlin
val result: Result? = get()

val message = when (result) {
    null -> "No result"
    is Result.Success -> "Got: ${result.data}"
    is Result.Error -> "Failed: ${result.message}"
    Result.Loading -> "Still loading"
}
```

The `null` branch must be handled explicitly since `when` is an expression and the compiler cannot
prove it covers the null case.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing `List<String?>` with `List<String>?`.** `List<String?>` is a non-null list whose
   elements may be null. `List<String>?` is a nullable list whose elements are non-null.

2. **Using !! on platform types from Java.** Java return values may be null at runtime regardless of
   how you use them in Kotlin. Always prefer safe calls or explicit null checks on Java data.

3. **Forgetting to handle null in when expressions.** When a `when` block is used as an expression
   and the subject is nullable, omitting the `null` branch is a compile error. Add it explicitly.

4. **Smart cast failure after property access.** Smart casts fail if the property is a `var` that
   could be modified between the check and usage. Use a local `val` to capture it:

   ```kotlin
   val local = user.name  // capture once
   if (local != null) {
       println(local.length)  // smart cast succeeds
   }
   ```

5. **Unnecessary nullable on generic types.** `List<String?>` vs `List<String>`. Mark nullability
   at the element level, not the collection level, unless the entire collection can be null.

6. **Overusing !! in tests.** `!!` is common in test code but hides bugs. Prefer `requireNotNull`
   with a descriptive message or use test assertion libraries that give clear failure messages.

7. **Forgetting that `lateinit` does not make a type nullable.** `lateinit var` bypasses null safety
   for non-null initialization. Accessing it before assignment throws
   `UninitializedPropertyAccessException`, not NPE.

## Summary

- Non-null types are the default in Kotlin; add `?` to make a type nullable.
- `?.` safely accesses nullable values; `?:` provides defaults.
- `let` scopes execute blocks on non-null receivers with smart-cast `it`.
- `!!` forces non-null with an NPE on null — prefer `requireNotNull` for better errors.
- Java interop uses platform types — annotate Java APIs with `@Nullable`/`@NotNull`.
- Smart casts after null checks are powered by compiler contracts on `inline` functions.
- `filterNotNull` and `mapNotNull` remove null elements; understand `List<String?>` vs
  `List<String>?`.
- Sealed classes guarantee exhaustive `when`; handle `null` branches explicitly when nullable.


## Intuition

Kotlin's null safety is like a building's fire code -- it prevents disasters by catching dangerous situations at the blueprint stage rather than after the building is occupied. The safe call operator (?.) is like a circuit breaker that stops the chain of operations if any link is null. The Elvis operator (?:) is the emergency generator that kicks in when the primary power fails. The !! operator is the red button you should rarely press -- it bypasses all safety checks and will crash the program if the value is actually null. Contracts are the fine print that tells the compiler exactly when it is safe to trust a non-null assertion.
