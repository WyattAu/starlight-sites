        return "warm"

```

The condition expression can be any Python object. Python evaluates its truthiness using the
`__bool__()` protocol described in the previous chapter. There is no requirement that the condition
Be a boolean -- this is consistent with Python's broader philosophy of duck typing.

```python
# All of these are valid conditional expressions
if [1, 2, 3]:
    print("non-empty list is truthy")

if "":
    print("this never executes")

if not None:
    print("None is falsy, so not None is truthy")
```

### Why Indentation for Blocks

This is one of Python's most controversial design decisions and the source of the most frequent
Criticism from programmers coming from brace-delimited languages. The rationale is both
Philosophical and practical:

1. **Eliminates a class of bugs.** In C-style languages, mismatched braces are a persistent source
   of errors. The compiler cannot detect whether the indentation reflects the programmer's intent
   because the braces define the actual structure. Python makes the indentation the structure --
   what you see is what the interpreter sees.

2. **Enforces a single canonical style.** Every Python program has consistent block structure. There
   is no debate over K&R versus Allman versus GNU indentation style because there is no choice. This
   reduces cognitive overhead in code reviews and eliminates formatting arguments.

3. **Reduces visual noise.** Braces, semicolons, and explicit block terminators are syntactic
   overhead that provides no semantic information beyond what indentation already conveys. Removing
   them makes code more compact without sacrificing readability.

4. **Historical precedent.** Guido van Rossum was influenced by ABC (a teaching language developed
   at CWI) and Haskell, both of which use indentation-based syntax. The choice was deliberate, not
   accidental.

The trade-off is sensitivity to whitespace. Mixing tabs and spaces, or inconsistent indentation,
Causes `IndentationError`. Python 3 disallows mixing tabs and spaces entirely within the same file.
PEP 8 mandates 4 spaces per indentation level.

:::caution

Python 3 raises `TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation` if a file mixes tabs
And spaces. Configure your editor to insert 4 spaces on Tab. Most linters and formatters (`ruff`
`black`) enforce this automatically.


### Conditional Expressions (Ternary)

Python provides a conditional expression (often called the ternary operator) with an ordering that
Reflects the English sentence structure:

```python
# Python's ternary: value_if_true IF condition ELSE value_if_false
status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"

# Equivalent long-form
if age >= 18:
    status = "adult"
else:
    status = "minor"
```

Note the ordering: the value comes first, then the condition. This differs from C's
`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`. The rationale is that in natural English, you state
The assertion first ("it is an adult") and then qualify it ("if age >= 18, otherwise it is a
Minor").

Nested ternary expressions are technically possible but should be avoided:

```python
# Works but harms readability
label = "positive" if x > 0 else "negative" if x < 0 else "zero"

# Prefer a function with if/elif/else for multi-way branching
def sign(x: float) -> str:
    if x > 0:
        return "positive"
    elif x < 0:
        return "negative"
    return "zero"
```

## Structural Pattern Matching (`match` / `case`)

Python 3.10 introduced structural pattern matching via PEP 634. This is not a C-style `switch`
Statement -- it is a fundamentally more powerful construct that performs **destructuring** of data
Structures.

### Why Structural Pattern Matching, Not C-Style Switch

C's `switch` is essentially a multi-way `if/elif` chain with fall-through semantics. It compares a
Single value against compile-time constants. Python's `match/case` does something fundamentally
Different: it matches the **structure** of the subject against a pattern, binding names to matched
Sub-components.

The design was driven by several considerations:

1. **Python already has dictionary dispatch.** The use case for simple value-based switching is
   already well-served by dictionary dispatch: `{"a": func_a, "b": func_b}[key]()`. Adding a C-style
   switch would be redundant.

2. **Algebraic data types are increasingly common.** Python codebases increasingly use
   `dataclasses``NamedTuple`And `TypedDict` to model structured data. Pattern matching provides a
   natural way to destructure these types.

3. **No fall-through.** Fall-through is the most error-prone feature of C's `switch`. Every `case`
   in Python's `match` is exclusive -- there is no way to accidentally fall through to the next
   case. This eliminates an entire class of bugs.

### Literal Patterns

```python
def http_status_text(code: int) -> str:
    match code:
        case 200:
            return "OK"
        case 404:
            return "Not Found"
        case 500:
            return "Internal Server Error"
        case _:
            return "Unknown"
```

The `_` is the wildcard pattern that matches anything. It is a common convention to place it last as
The default case.

### Capture Patterns and Guards

Patterns can bind variables, and `if` guards add additional conditions:

```python
def describe_point(point: tuple[float, float]) -> str:
    match point:
        case (0, 0):
            return "origin"
        case (0, y):
            return f"on y-axis at y={y}"
        case (x, 0):
            return f"on x-axis at x={x}"
        case (x, y) if x == y:
            return f"on diagonal at ({x}, {y})"
        case (x, y) if x > 0 and y > 0:
            return f"first quadrant at ({x}, {y})"
        case (x, y):
            return f"at ({x}, {y})"
```

### Structural Patterns with Classes

Pattern matching works with class instances, matching by the constructor signature:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Circle:
    radius: float

@dataclass
class Rectangle:
    width: float
    height: float

@dataclass
class Triangle:
    base: float
    height: float

def area(shape: Circle | Rectangle | Triangle) -> float:
    match shape:
        case Circle(radius=r):
            return 3.14159 * r * r
        case Rectangle(width=w, height=h):
            return w * h
        case Triangle(base=b, height=h):
            return 0.5 * b * h
```

This destructuring works because the pattern matches the keyword arguments of the class constructor.
For plain classes (not dataclasses), you need to implement `__match_args__` or use positional
Patterns:

```python
class Point:
    __match_args__ = ("x", "y")

    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

match point:
    case Point(x, y):
        print(f"point at ({x}, {y})")
```

### Nested Patterns and Mapping Patterns

```python
def process_config(config: dict) -> str:
    match config:
        case {"database": {"host": str(), "port": int()}}:
            return "valid database config"
        case {"database": {"host": str()}}:
            return "database config missing port"
        case {"cache": {"provider": "redis", **rest}}:
            return f"redis config with options: {rest}"
        case _:
            return "unknown config structure"
```

### Pattern Matching Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[match subject] --> B{case pattern 1}
    B -->|Match| C[Execute case 1 body]
    B -->|No match| D{case pattern 2}
    D -->|Match| E[Execute case 2 body]
    D -->|No match| F{case pattern N}
    F -->|Match| G[Execute case N body]
    F -->|No match| H[No match: proceed to next statement]
    C --> I[Continue after match block]
    E --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

:::
:::info

Pattern matching is exhaustive only if you provide a wildcard `_` case. Without it, no match Means
the `match` block is skipped entirely -- it does not raise an error. This differs from Rust's
`match`Which requires exhaustiveness at compile time.


## Loops

### `for` Loops and the Iterator Protocol

Python's `for` loop is fundamentally different from C's `for (init; condition; increment)` loop. It
Operates on **iterables** -- objects that implement the iterator protocol.

```python
# The 'for' loop is syntactic sugar for this:
for item in iterable:
    process(item)

# Which the interpreter expands to approximately:
iterator = iter(iterable)
while True:
    try:
        item = next(iterator)
    except StopIteration:
        break
    process(item)
```

This design means that Python's `for` loop can iterate over anything that produces values
Sequentially -- lists, strings, files, database cursors, generator functions, infinite sequences.
The iterator protocol is the universal interface for sequential access in Python.

An object is iterable if it implements `__iter__()` (returning an iterator) or `__getitem__()` (for
Sequence-style access with integer indices starting at 0). An iterator is an object that implements
`__next__()` (returning the next value) and raises `StopIteration` when exhausted.

### `range`

`range` produces an arithmetic sequence of integers. It is lazy -- it does not materialize the
Entire sequence in memory, regardless of the size.

```python
# range(stop)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# range(start, stop)
for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i)  # 2, 3, 4, 5

# range(start, stop, step)
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

# Negative step: count backwards
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)  # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

# range is a sequence type -- supports 'in' and 'len' in O(1)
print(5 in range(1000000))    # True, instant check
print(len(range(1000000)))    # 1000000
```

`range` objects implement the sequence protocol (`__contains__``__len__``__getitem__`) with $O(1)$
membership testing. `x in range(n)` does not iterate through the range -- it computes the Answer
directly.

### `enumerate`

`enumerate` wraps an iterable and yields `(index, value)` pairs. It is the Pythonic alternative to
Manual counter variables.

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Unpythonic: manual counter
i = 0
for word in words:
    print(f"{i}: {word}")
    i += 1

# Pythonic: enumerate
for i, word in enumerate(words):
    print(f"{i}: {word}")

# Custom start index
for i, word in enumerate(words, start=1):
    print(f"{i}: {word}")  # 1: apple, 2: banana, ...
```

### `zip`

`zip` aggregates elements from multiple iterables into tuples. It stops at the shortest iterable.

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
scores = [95, 87, 92]
grades = ["A", "B+", "A-"]

for name, score, grade in zip(names, scores, grades):
    print(f"{name}: {score} ({grade})")

# zip produces tuples
print(list(zip(names, scores)))
# [("Alice", 95), ("Bob", 87), ("Charlie", 92)]

# zip_longest from itertools fills missing values
from itertools import zip_longest
print(list(zip_longest(names, scores, fillvalue="N/A")))
```

### `itertools`

The `itertools` module provides a collection of fast, memory-efficient tools for working with
Iterators. These are building blocks for functional-style programming.

```python
from itertools import chain, islice, cycle, repeat, takewhile, dropwhile, groupby, product, permutations, combinations

# chain: flatten iterables
print(list(chain([1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6])))
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# islice: slice an iterator
print(list(islice(range(100), 5, 10)))
# [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# cycle: infinite repetition
# for item in cycle(["A", "B", "C"]):
#     print(item)  # A, B, C, A, B, C, ...

# repeat: repeat a single value
print(list(repeat(42, 3)))
# [42, 42, 42]

# takewhile / dropwhile: conditional iteration
print(list(takewhile(lambda x: x < 5, range(10))))
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list(dropwhile(lambda x: x < 5, range(10))))
# [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# product: Cartesian product (nested loops as an iterator)
print(list(product([1, 2], ["a", "b"])))
# [(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b')]

# permutations and combinations
print(list(permutations([1, 2, 3], 2)))
# [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)]
print(list(combinations([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)))
# [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
```

### `while` Loops

`while` loops repeat as long as a condition remains truthy. They are appropriate when the number of
Iterations is not known in advance.

```python
import random

def estimate_pi(trials: int) -> float:
    inside = 0
    for _ in range(trials):
        x, y = random.random(), random.random()
        if x * x + y * y <= 1.0:
            inside += 1
    return 4.0 * inside / trials

def converge_pi(target_error: float = 1e-5) -> float:
    estimate = 0.0
    trials = 0
    while True:
        trials += 1000
        new_estimate = estimate_pi(trials)
        if abs(new_estimate - estimate) < target_error and trials > 1000:
            return new_estimate
        estimate = new_estimate
```

:::
:::caution

A `while True` loop with no `break` condition is an infinite loop. While occasionally intentional
(server main loops, event loops), an accidental infinite loop freezes the program. Always ensure
There is a reachable termination condition.


### `break``continue`And Loop `else`

Python loops support `break` (exit the loop immediately), `continue` (skip to the next iteration),
And an `else` clause that executes only when the loop completes without hitting `break`.

```python
# break: exit the loop
def find_first_prime(numbers: list[int]) -> int | None:
    for n in numbers:
        if n < 2:
            continue
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                break  # not prime, try next number
        else:
            # This 'else' belongs to the inner 'for' loop.
            # It executes only if the loop completed without break.
            return n  # n is prime
    return None  # no prime found

# continue: skip current iteration
def process_positive(numbers: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    results = []
    for n in numbers:
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        results.append(n * 2)
    return results

# The else clause on while loops
def binary_search(sorted_list: list[int], target: int) -> int | None:
    low, high = 0, len(sorted_list) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if sorted_list[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    else:
        # Executes only when low > high (not found)
        return None
```

The loop `else` clause is one of Python's most misunderstood features. It is not analogous to the
`else` in `if/else`. It executes when the loop condition becomes false (for `while`) or the iterable
Is exhausted (for `for`), but not when the loop is exited via `break`. The mental model is: the
`else` clause is the "no break" clause.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[while condition] -->|True| B[loop body]
    B --> C{break?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Skip else, continue after loop]
    C -->|No| A
    A -->|False| E[Execute else clause]
    E --> F[Continue after loop]
```

## Comprehensions and Generator Expressions

### List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise syntax for creating lists from iterables. They are more
Readable and often faster than equivalent `for` loops with `append`.

```python
# Basic comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
# [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# With a condition (filter)
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]

# With transformation
labels = [f"item_{i}" for i in range(5)]
# ["item_0", "item_1", "item_2", "item_3", "item_4"]

# Nested comprehension (flattening a matrix)
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flat = [element for row in matrix for element in row]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

The execution order of nested comprehensions follows the same left-to-right reading order as nested
`for` loops. The first `for` is the outer loop, the second `for` is the inner loop.

:::
:::caution

List comprehensions create the entire list in memory. For large datasets, prefer generator
Expressions. A comprehension over a billion-element range would consume all available memory.


### Dict Comprehensions

```python
# Invert a dictionary
original = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
inverted = {v: k for k, v in original.items()}
# {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c"}

# Transform values
prices = {"apple": 1.2, "banana": 0.8, "cherry": 2.5}
with_tax = {item: round(price * 1.1, 2) for item, price in prices.items()}

# From two parallel iterables
keys = ["x", "y", "z"]
values = [10, 20, 30]
mapping = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
```

### Set Comprehensions

```python
# Unique word lengths
words = ["hello", "world", "python", "code", "rust"]
lengths = {len(word) for word in words}
# {4, 5, 6}

# Remove duplicates while transforming
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
unique_squares = {x**2 for x in data}
# {1, 4, 9, 16}
```

### Generator Expressions

Generator expressions have the same syntax as list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of
Brackets. They produce values lazily, one at a time, and do not store the entire result in memory.

```python
# List comprehension: creates full list in memory
squares_list = [x**2 for x in range(1000000)]

# Generator expression: produces values on demand
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1000000))

# Generator expressions are consumed by iteration
total = sum(x**2 for x in range(1000000))  # no intermediate list

# Passing a generator to functions that accept iterables
import math
max_root = max(math.sqrt(x) for x in range(100))

# Chaining generator expressions
result = (x for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 0)
result = (x * 2 for x in result)
result = (x + 1 for x in result)
print(list(result))  # [1, 5, 9, 13, ...]
```

:::
:::tip

When a comprehension is the sole argument to a function, the enclosing parentheses can be omitted:
`sum(x**2 for x in range(100))` is valid. The generator expression syntax
`(x**2 for x in range(100))` is required in all other contexts.


### Comprehension Scope

Comprehensions have their own local scope in Python 3. Variables assigned inside a comprehension do
Not leak into the enclosing scope (this was a change from Python 2, where list comprehensions leaked
The loop variable).

```python
# Python 3: comprehension has its own scope
x = "before"
[x * 2 for x in range(5)]
print(x)  # "before" -- x is unchanged

# The iteration variable is local to the comprehension
result = [y for y in range(10)]
# 'y' does not exist here in Python 3
```

## The Walrus Operator (`:=`)

The assignment expression (walrus operator, PEP 572, Python 3.8+) allows you to assign a value to a
Variable as part of an expression. This eliminates the need for separate assignment statements in
Cases where you want to both use a value and give it a name.

```python
# Without walrus: two steps
data = get_data()
if data is not None:
    process(data)

# With walrus: one step
if (data := get_data()) is not None:
    process(data)

# Filtering with computation (avoiding double evaluation)
results = [y for x in data if (y := expensive_transform(x)) is not None]

# While loop with inline update
while chunk := file.read(8192):
    process(chunk)

# Reuse in multiple conditions
if (match := pattern.search(text)) and match.group(1).isdigit():
    number = int(match.group(1))
```

The walrus operator has lower precedence than most operators but higher than commas. Parentheses are
Required in comprehensions and `if`/`while` conditions.

:::
:::caution

The walrus operator should be used sparingly. It improves clarity when it avoids redundant
Computation or awkward workarounds. It harms clarity when it makes a single line do too much. The
Guiding principle: use it when it eliminates a clear redundancy, not just to save a line.


## Exception Handling

### `try` / `except` / `else` / `finally`

Python's exception handling mechanism is the primary error-handling idiom. Unlike return codes or
Error objects, exceptions decouple error detection from error handling -- the function that detects
The error does not need to know how to handle it.

```python
def read_config(path: str) -> dict:
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise ConfigError(f"Config file not found: {path}")
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        raise ConfigError(f"Invalid JSON in config file: {path}") from e
    else:
        # Executes only if no exception was raised
        # Useful for code that should only run on success
        log.info(f"Config loaded from {path}")
    finally:
        # Always executes, regardless of exceptions
        # Useful for cleanup that must happen no matter what
        pass
```

The four clauses have distinct roles:

| Clause    | Executes when                             | Purpose                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `except`  | The specified exception is raised         | Handle the error, recover, or re-raise    |
| `else`    | No exception is raised in the `try` block | Code that depends on the `try` succeeding |
| `finally` | Always, even if an exception is unhandled | Cleanup that must happen regardless       |

The `else` clause exists to prevent a subtle bug: catching an exception that was raised by the
Error-handling code itself, not by the code you intended to protect.

```python
# BUG: if json.load succeeds but log.info raises an exception,
# the except catches it, masking the real problem
try:
    data = json.load(f)
    log.info("loaded successfully")  # this is protected too
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    handle_error()

# CORRECT: the else clause separates success code from protected code
try:
    data = json.load(f)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    handle_error()
else:
    log.info("loaded successfully")  # only runs if json.load succeeded
```

### Exception Hierarchy

All built-in exceptions inherit from `BaseException`. The hierarchy matters because `except` clauses
Catch the specified exception and all its subclasses.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    BE["BaseException"]
    BE --> SysE["SystemExit"]
    BE --> KE["KeyboardInterrupt"]
    BE --> GE["GeneratorExit"]
    BE --> E["Exception"]
    E --> SE["StopIteration"]
    E --> AE["ArithmeticError"]
    AE --> ZE["ZeroDivisionError"]
    AE --> OE["OverflowError"]
    E --> LE["LookupError"]
    LE --> KE2["KeyError"]
    LE --> IE["IndexError"]
    E --> TE["TypeError"]
    E --> VE["ValueError"]
    E --> AE2["AttributeError"]
    E --> NE["NameError"]
    E --> FE["FileNotFoundError"]
    VE --> JE["JSONDecodeError"]
```

:::
:::caution

Never use a bare `except:` (which catches everything including `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`)
Or `except Exception` without careful consideration. Catching too broadly masks real errors and
Makes debugging extremely difficult. Catch the most specific exception possible.


### Custom Exceptions

```python
class AppError(Exception):
    """Base class for all application exceptions."""

class ConfigError(AppError):
    """Raised when configuration is invalid or missing."""

class NetworkError(AppError):
    """Raised when a network operation fails."""

class ValidationError(AppError):
    """Raised when input validation fails."""

    def __init__(self, field: str, message: str):
        self.field = field
        super().__init__(f"Validation failed for '{field}': {message}")
```

Custom exceptions should inherit from `Exception` (not `BaseException`). Group related exceptions
Under a common base class so callers can catch the entire category:

```python
try:
    result = perform_operation()
except ConfigError:
    initialize_defaults()
except NetworkError:
    retry_with_backoff()
except AppError as e:
    log.error(f"Unexpected application error: {e}")
    raise
```

### Exception Chaining (`raise ... from`)

Python 3 supports explicit exception chaining, which preserves the original cause when raising a new
Exception.

```python
def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}")
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.HTTPError as e:
        raise NetworkError(f"Failed to fetch user {user_id}") from e
    except requests.ConnectionError as e:
        raise NetworkError(f"Cannot connect to API") from e
```

The `from e` clause sets `__cause__` on the new exception, creating an explicit chain. The full
Traceback includes both the original and the wrapping exception, making diagnosis straightforward.

```python
# Explicit chaining: raise NewError from original_error
# __cause__ is set to original_error

# Implicit chaining: raise NewError inside an except block
# __context__ is set to the caught exception automatically

# Suppress chaining: raise NewError from None
# No __cause__ or __context__ is set
# Use this when the new exception is self-explanatory
```

### Exception Propagation Flow

    F2 -->|No| K["Continue"]
    G2 --> K
```

### `assert`

Assertions are debugging aids that check conditions that should be true. They are not for data
Validation or error handling.

```python
def binary_search(arr: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        assert 0 <= mid < len(arr), f"mid={mid} out of bounds"
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

:::
:::caution

Assertions are stripped when Python runs with the `-O` (optimize) flag. Never use assertions for
Input validation or security checks. Use explicit `if/raise` for conditions that must be checked in
Production.


## Context Managers

### The `with` Statement

Context managers manage resources that need explicit setup and teardown. The `with` statement
Guarantees that cleanup code runs regardless of whether the block succeeds or raises an exception.

```python
# File handling: the file is closed even if an exception occurs
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    process(content)
# f.close() is called automatically here

# Lock management: the lock is released even on exception
from threading import Lock
lock = Lock()

with lock:
    shared_resource.modify()
# lock.release() is called automatically here
```

The `with` statement calls `__enter__()` on the context manager when entering the block and
`__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)` when leaving. The `__exit__` method receives the exception
Information if an exception was raised, allowing it to suppress the exception by returning `True`.

```python
class Timer:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.elapsed: float = 0.0

    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.perf_counter()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.elapsed = time.perf_counter() - self.start
        print(f"{self.name}: {self.elapsed:.4f}s")
        return False  # do not suppress exceptions

with Timer("data processing"):
    process_large_dataset()
```

### `contextlib`

The `contextlib` module provides utilities for creating and composing context managers.

#### `contextmanager` Decorator

The `@contextmanager` decorator turns a generator function into a context manager. The code before
`yield` runs on entry, the code after `yield` runs on exit.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
import tempfile
import os
import shutil

@contextmanager
def temporary_directory():
    """Create a temporary directory that is cleaned up on exit."""
    tmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        yield tmpdir
    finally:
        shutil.rmtree(tmpdir)

with temporary_directory() as tmpdir:
    # tmpdir exists and is usable
    write_files(tmpdir)
# tmpdir is deleted here, even if write_files raised an exception
```

#### `suppress`

`suppress` provides a cleaner way to ignore specific exceptions, replacing the common pattern of
Empty `except` blocks.

```python
from contextlib import suppress

# Instead of:
try:
    os.remove("temp_file.txt")
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass

# Use suppress:
with suppress(FileNotFoundError):
    os.remove("temp_file.txt")
```

#### `closing`

`closing` calls the `close()` method on any object that has one, ensuring cleanup.

```python
from contextlib import closing
import urllib.request

with closing(urllib.request.urlopen("https://example.com")) as response:
    data = response.read()
```

#### Multiple Context Managers

Python supports entering multiple context managers in a single `with` statement:

```python
with open("input.txt") as infile, open("output.txt", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(infile.read())

# For long lines, use parentheses
with (
    open("input.txt") as infile,
    open("output.txt", "w") as outfile,
    Timer("processing"),
):
    outfile.write(infile.read())
```

### Why Context Managers Instead of RAII

Languages like C++ use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) -- destructors run
Automatically when objects go out of scope. Python does not use RAII because:

1. **Garbage collection is non-deterministic.** Python uses reference counting with a
   cycle-detecting garbage collector. Objects are not destroyed at a predictable time. An object's
   `__del__` method (Python's equivalent of a destructor) may run long after the object becomes
   unreachable, or not at all if it is part of a reference cycle.

2. **Explicit is better than implicit.** The `with` statement makes resource acquisition and release
   visible in the code structure. A reader can see exactly where resources are managed without
   tracing object lifetimes.

3. **Exceptions require explicit handling.** RAII destructors cannot distinguish between normal
   scope exit and exception-propagated scope exit without additional machinery. The `__exit__`
   method receives exception information directly.

```python
# This is unreliable -- __del__ may run much later, or not at all
class UnreliableCleanup:
    def __del__(self):
        self.close()  # may never be called if part of a reference cycle

# This is reliable -- cleanup happens at a well-defined point
class ReliableCleanup:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.open()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        self.close()
```

:::
:::tip

Always use `with` statements for file I/O, database connections, network sockets, locks, and any
Other resource that requires explicit cleanup. Never rely on `__del__` or the garbage collector for
Resource management.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing authentication (who you are) with authorisation (what you can do) in security contexts.

2. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).

3. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.

4. Confusing an algorithm with a program — an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, not its
   implementation in code.
