## threading Module

The `threading` module provides low-level thread primitives. Python threads are OS-level threads
Managed by the platform's native threading implementation (pthreads on Linux, Windows threads on
Windows).

### Creating Threads

```python
import threading
import time

def worker(thread_id, duration):
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} starting")
    time.sleep(duration)
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} finished after {duration}s")

threads = []
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i, i + 1))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()  # Wait for all threads to complete

print("All threads finished")
```

### Thread Subclassing

```python
import threading

class WorkerThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, name, task_data):
        super().__init__(name=name)
        self.task_data = task_data
        self.result = None

    def run(self):
        print(f"{self.name} processing {self.task_data}")
        self.result = f"processed_{self.task_data}"

t = WorkerThread("worker-1", "task-a")
t.start()
t.join()
print(t.result)  # processed_task-a
```

### Daemon Threads

```python
import threading
import time

def daemon_worker():
    while True:
        print("Daemon running")
        time.sleep(1)

def regular_worker():
    time.sleep(3)
    print("Regular worker done")

d = threading.Thread(target=daemon_worker, daemon=True)
r = threading.Thread(target=regular_worker)

d.start()
r.start()

## When the main thread exits, daemon threads are killed immediately
## Regular threads keep the process alive
r.join()  # Wait for regular thread
# Program exits here — daemon thread is terminated
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Locks, close files, or flush buffers. Use them only for non-critical background tasks.
</aside>
## Lock and RLock

### Lock (Mutex)

```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment(n):
    global counter
    for _ in range(n):
        with lock:
            counter += 1

threads = [
    threading.Thread(target=increment, args=(100000,)),
    threading.Thread(target=increment, args=(100000,)),
]

for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(f"Counter: {counter}")  # Counter: 200000
```

Without the lock, `counter += 1` is not atomic — it involves reading, incrementing, and writing,
Which can be interleaved between threads.

### RLock (Reentrant Lock)

```python
import threading

lock = threading.RLock()

def outer():
    with lock:
        print("outer acquired")
        inner()

def inner():
    with lock:
        print("inner acquired — same thread, reentrant")

outer()  # Works fine — RLock allows same thread to re-acquire
```

| Feature               | `Lock`         | `RLock`                  |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Reentrant             | No (deadlocks) | Yes                      |
| Release by any thread | Yes            | No (must be same thread) |
| `acquire()` counting  | No             | Yes                      |
| Overhead              | Lower          | Slightly higher          |

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
thread must call `release()` the same number of times it called `acquire()`.
</aside>
## Semaphore, Event, Condition, Barrier

### Semaphore

```python
import threading
import time

semaphore = threading.Semaphore(3)  # Allow 3 concurrent accesses

def access_resource(thread_id):
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} waiting...")
    with semaphore:
        print(f"Thread {thread_id} acquired, working...")
        time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} released")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=access_resource, args=(i,)) for i in range(6)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

### Event

```python
import threading

event = threading.Event()

def waiter(name):
    print(f"{name} waiting for signal")
    event.wait()
    print(f"{name} received signal, proceeding")

def setter():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Setting event")
    event.set()

w1 = threading.Thread(target=waiter, args=("W1",))
w2 = threading.Thread(target=waiter, args=("W2",))
s = threading.Thread(target=setter)

w1.start()
w2.start()
s.start()

w1.join()
w2.join()
s.join()
```

### Condition

```python
import threading
import time
import random

buffer = []
buffer_lock = threading.Condition()
MAX_SIZE = 5

def producer():
    for i in range(10):
        with buffer_lock:
            while len(buffer) >= MAX_SIZE:
                buffer_lock.wait()
            item = f"item_{i}"
            buffer.append(item)
            print(f"Produced: {item}, buffer size: {len(buffer)}")
            buffer_lock.notify()
        time.sleep(random.random() * 0.1)

def consumer():
    for _ in range(10):
        with buffer_lock:
            while len(buffer) == 0:
                buffer_lock.wait()
            item = buffer.pop(0)
            print(f"Consumed: {item}, buffer size: {len(buffer)}")
            buffer_lock.notify()
        time.sleep(random.random() * 0.1)

p = threading.Thread(target=producer)
c = threading.Thread(target=consumer)
p.start()
c.start()
p.join()
c.join()
```

### Barrier

```python
import threading

barrier = threading.Barrier(3)

def phase(thread_id):
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} in phase 1")
    barrier.wait()
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} in phase 2")
    barrier.wait()
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} done")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=phase, args=(i,)) for i in range(3)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

## multiprocessing

The `multiprocessing` module creates separate OS processes, each with its own Python interpreter and
GIL. This is the primary way to achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound work in Python.

### Basic Usage

```python
import multiprocessing

def square(x):
    return x * x

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with multiprocessing.Pool(4) as pool:
        results = pool.map(square, range(10))
    print(results)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Parent process memory (copy-on-write). On Windows, it uses `spawn()`Which re-imports the module.
Always protect entry points with `if __name__ == "__main__"` to avoid infinite recursion on Windows.
</aside>
### Process

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def compute(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i ** 2
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start = time.time()
    processes = []
    for i in range(4):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=compute, args=(10_000_000,))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()
    for p in processes:
        p.join()
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"4 processes: {elapsed:.2f}s")
```

### Shared Memory

```python
import multiprocessing

def increment(counter, lock):
    for _ in range(100000):
        with lock:
            counter.value += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    counter = multiprocessing.Value("i", 0)  # Signed integer
    lock = multiprocessing.Lock()

    processes = [
        multiprocessing.Process(target=increment, args=(counter, lock))
        for _ in range(4)
    ]

    for p in processes:
        p.start()
    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    print(f"Counter: {counter.value}")  # Counter: 400000
```

### Shared Array

```python
import multiprocessing

def fill_array(arr, start, end):
    for i in range(start, end):
        arr[i] = i * i

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = multiprocessing.Array("d", 100)  # Array of doubles
    size = len(arr)
    chunk = size // 4

    processes = [
        multiprocessing.Process(target=fill_array, args=(arr, i * chunk, (i + 1) * chunk))
        for i in range(4)
    ]

    for p in processes:
        p.start()
    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    print(list(arr[:10]))  # [0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 9.0, 16.0, 25.0, 36.0, 49.0, 64.0, 81.0]
```

### Pipe

```python
import multiprocessing

def sender(conn):
    conn.send(["hello", "from", "sender"])
    conn.close()

def receiver(conn):
    data = conn.recv()
    print(f"Received: {data}")
    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parent_conn, child_conn = multiprocessing.Pipe()
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=sender, args=(child_conn,))
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=receiver, args=(parent_conn,))

    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
Communication by default. For one-way communication, use `duplex=False`.
</aside>
## concurrent.futures

`concurrent.futures` provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables using
Threads or processes.

### ThreadPoolExecutor

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
import time

def fetch_url(url):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate network latency
    return f"fetched {url}"

urls = [f"http://example.com/page/{i}" for i in range(10)]

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    futures = {executor.submit(fetch_url, url): url for url in urls}
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        url = futures[future]
        try:
            result = future.result()
            print(result)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
```

### ProcessPoolExecutor

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
import time

def cpu_bound(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i ** 3
    return total

start = time.time()
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(cpu_bound, [10_000_000] * 8))
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f"Elapsed: {elapsed:.2f}s, results: {results[:2]}...")
```

### submit vs map

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process(item):
    return item * 2

# map — simple, ordered, blocks until all complete
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process, range(5)))
    print(results)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# submit — more control, unordered results
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(process, i) for i in range(5)]
    for future in futures:
        print(future.result())  # May be out of order
```

### Exception Handling

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def may_fail(x):
    if x == 3:
        raise ValueError(f"Cannot process {x}")
    return x * 2

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(may_fail, i) for i in range(5)]
    for future in futures:
        try:
            print(future.result())
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Failed: {e}")
# 0, 2, Failed: Cannot process 3, 6, 8
```

## queue Module

The `queue` module provides thread-safe FIFO, LIFO, and priority queues.

### Queue (FIFO)

```python
import queue
import threading

q = queue.Queue(maxsize=10)

def producer():
    for i in range(20):
        q.put(f"item_{i}")
        print(f"Produced item_{i}")

def consumer():
    while True:
        item = q.get()
        print(f"Consumed {item}")
        q.task_done()

p = threading.Thread(target=producer)
c = threading.Thread(target=consumer, daemon=True)

p.start()
c.start()
p.join()
q.join()  # Block until all items are processed
```

### LifoQueue

```python
import queue

lq = queue.LifoQueue()
lq.put(1)
lq.put(2)
lq.put(3)
print(lq.get())  # 3 — last in, first out
print(lq.get())  # 2
```

### PriorityQueue

```python
import queue

pq = queue.PriorityQueue()
pq.put((2, "medium priority"))
pq.put((1, "high priority"))
pq.put((3, "low priority"))

print(pq.get())  # (1, 'high priority')
print(pq.get())  # (2, 'medium priority')
print(pq.get())  # (3, 'low priority')
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--note">
Equal, it compares the second, and so on. If items are not comparable, it raises `TypeError`.

## GIL Impact Analysis

The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing
Multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously.

### CPU-Bound vs I/O-Bound

| Workload  | Threading                         | Multiprocessing                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| CPU-bound | No speedup (GIL bottleneck)       | Linear speedup (up to core count) |
| I/O-bound | Speedup (GIL released during I/O) | Overkill (higher overhead)        |

```python
import threading
import multiprocessing
import time

def cpu_task(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i ** 2
    return total

def io_task():
    import urllib.request
    urllib.request.urlopen("http://httpbin.org/delay/0.1")
    return "done"

# CPU-bound: threading gives NO speedup
# Multiprocessing gives near-linear speedup

# I/O-bound: threading gives speedup with lower overhead
# Multiprocessing also works but has higher memory/process overhead
```

### When GIL Is Released

The GIL is released during:

- I/O operations (file read/write, network requests)
- `time.sleep()`
- C extensions that explicitly release the GIL (NumPy, database drivers)
- `concurrent.futures` operations

The GIL is held during:

- Pure Python computation
- Reference counting operations
- Attribute access on Python objects

## asyncio vs Threading vs Multiprocessing

### Decision Framework

```
Is the workload I/O-bound?
├── Yes
│   ├── Is simplicity important?
│   │   ├── Yes → asyncio (single-threaded, no race conditions)
│   │   └── No → threading (familiar model, blocking APIs)
│   └── Do you need to integrate with blocking libraries?
│       ├── Yes → threading (or run in executor)
│       └── No → asyncio
└── No (CPU-bound)
    ├── Need true parallelism?
    │   ├── Yes → multiprocessing
    │   └── No → asyncio (with run_in_executor for heavy work)
    └── Shared memory required?
        ├── Yes → multiprocessing with shared state
        └── No → multiprocessing
```

### Benchmark Template

```python
import time
import threading
import multiprocessing
import asyncio

def measure(label, func):
    start = time.time()
    func()
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"{label}: {elapsed:.3f}s")

# CPU-bound benchmark
def cpu_work():
    total = 0
    for i in range(5_000_000):
        total += i ** 2
    return total

def sequential_cpu():
    for _ in range(4):
        cpu_work()

def threaded_cpu():
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=cpu_work) for _ in range(4)]
    for t in threads: t.start()
    for t in threads: t.join()

def multiprocess_cpu():
    with multiprocessing.Pool(4) as pool:
        pool.map(cpu_work, range(4))

measure("sequential CPU", sequential_cpu)
measure("threaded CPU", threaded_cpu)
measure("multiprocess CPU", multiprocess_cpu)
```

## Practical Patterns

### Worker Pool

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
import time

def process_task(task_id):
    time.sleep(0.5)
    return f"result_{task_id}"

tasks = range(20)

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    future_to_id = {executor.submit(process_task, tid): tid for tid in tasks}
    for future in as_completed(future_to_id):
        tid = future_to_id[future]
        result = future.result()
        print(f"Task {tid}: {result}")
```

### Producer-Consumer with Queue

```python
import threading
import queue
import time
import random

work_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=100)
results = []
results_lock = threading.Lock()

def producer():
    for i in range(50):
        work_queue.put(i)
        time.sleep(random.random() * 0.01)

def consumer(worker_id):
    while True:
        try:
            item = work_queue.get(timeout=1)
            time.sleep(random.random() * 0.05)
            with results_lock:
                results.append((worker_id, item))
            work_queue.task_done()
        except queue.Empty:
            break

producers = [threading.Thread(target=producer) for _ in range(2)]
consumers = [threading.Thread(target=consumer, args=(i,)) for i in range(5)]

for p in producers: p.start()
time.sleep(0.1)
for c in consumers: c.start()

for p in producers: p.join()
work_queue.join()
for c in consumers: c.join()

print(f"Processed {len(results)} items")
```

### Fan-Out / Fan-In

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed

def fetch_metrics(server):
    # Simulate fetching metrics from a server
    import time
    time.sleep(0.5)
    return {server: {"cpu": 50, "memory": 70}}

servers = [f"server-{i}.example.com" for i in range(10)]

# Fan-out: submit all tasks
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    futures = {executor.submit(fetch_metrics, s): s for s in servers}

    # Fan-in: collect all results
    all_metrics = {}
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        result = future.result()
        all_metrics.update(result)

print(f"Collected metrics from {len(all_metrics)} servers")
```

## Intuition

Concurrency is about doing many things at once, but Python's GIL means threads cannot truly execute Python code in parallel. Think of threads like workers sharing a single tool — they can take turns using it, but only one can hold the tool at a time. Multiprocessing gives each worker their own tool, but now they cannot efficiently share notes. Locks are like traffic lights at an intersection — they prevent crashes by ensuring only one direction moves at a time. The event loop is a single waiter serving many tables — they take orders from one table, start it cooking, then move to the next while the first one waits. The right concurrency model depends on whether your bottleneck is waiting for external systems or crunching numbers.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Deadlock with Locks

```python
import threading

lock_a = threading.Lock()
lock_b = threading.Lock()

def task1():
    with lock_a:
        time.sleep(0.1)
        with lock_b:  # Deadlock if task2 holds lock_b
            print("task1 done")

def task2():
    with lock_b:
        time.sleep(0.1)
        with lock_a:  # Deadlock if task1 holds lock_a
            print("task2 done")

# Fix: always acquire locks in the same order
def task1_fixed():
    with lock_a:
        time.sleep(0.1)
        with lock_b:
            print("task1 done")

def task2_fixed():
    with lock_a:  # Same order as task1
        time.sleep(0.1)
        with lock_b:
            print("task2 done")
```

### 2. Forgetting to Join

```python
import threading
import time

def worker():
    time.sleep(2)

# Without join, main thread exits before worker finishes
t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
t.start()
# t.join()  # Must call join to wait
```

### 3. Shared Mutable State Without Locking

```python
import threading

counter = 0  # Shared mutable state — no lock!

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        counter += 1  # NOT atomic!

threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(4)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()

print(f"Counter: {counter}")  # NOT 400000 — likely less due to races
```

### 4. Multiprocessing with Lambdas

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

# This fails — lambdas are not picklable by default
# executor = ProcessPoolExecutor()
# executor.submit(lambda x: x * 2, 5)  # PicklingError

# Fix: use named functions or functools.partial
def double(x):
    return x * 2

with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    result = executor.submit(double, 5).result()
    print(result)  # 10
```

### 5. Queue.get() Without Timeout

```python
import queue
import threading

q = queue.Queue()

def consumer():
    # This blocks forever if no more items arrive
    item = q.get()  # Blocks indefinitely

# Fix: use timeout or sentinel value
def consumer_fixed():
    try:
        item = q.get(timeout=5)
    except queue.Empty:
        print("No items available")

# Or use a sentinel:
STOP_SENTINEL = object()

def consumer_sentinel():
    while True:
        item = q.get()
        if item is STOP_SENTINEL:
            break
        print(f"Processing {item}")
```

### 6. ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-Bound Work

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time

def heavy_computation(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i ** 2
    return total

# Wrong: ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-bound work — GIL prevents parallelism
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(heavy_computation, [10_000_000] * 8))

# Correct: ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound work
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(heavy_computation, [10_000_000] * 8))
```

### 7. Thread Safety of print()

```python
import threading

# print() is NOT atomic — output from multiple threads may interleave
def noisy_worker(thread_id):
    for _ in range(100):
        print(f"[{thread_id}] message")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=noisy_worker, args=(i,)) for i in range(5)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()
# Output may have garbled lines like: [1] mes[2] message
```

Use a `threading.Lock()` around `print()` calls or use the `logging` module which is thread-safe.

## Summary

This topic covers the core concepts of concurrency primitives, including underlying theory,
practical implementation, and key applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- core concepts and terminology
- algorithms and computational thinking
- practical implementation
- security and ethical considerations
- applications in the real world

Understanding these concepts thoroughly is essential for both examinations and practical
programming, and requires both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice.

## Worked Examples

Worked examples demonstrating the application of key concepts are covered in the detailed sub-pages
