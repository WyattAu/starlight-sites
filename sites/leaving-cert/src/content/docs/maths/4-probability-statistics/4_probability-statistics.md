## Probability and Statistics

Probability and statistics appear on both papers of the Leaving Certificate Mathematics examination.
This topic covers counting principles, probability rules, distributions, hypothesis testing, and
Statistical measures.

## Counting Principles

### Fundamental Counting Principle (OL/HL)

If task A can be done in $m$ ways and task B in $n$ ways, then A followed by B can be done in
$m \times n$ ways. This extends to any finite sequence of tasks: multiply the number of choices at
Each step.

**Example (OL):** How many ways can 3 different books be arranged on a shelf?

$$
3! = 6
$$

### Permutations (OL/HL)

The number of arrangements of $r$ objects from $n$ distinct objects:

$$
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
$$

**Example (HL):** How many ways can a committee chair, secretary, and treasurer be chosen from 10
People?

$$
P(10, 3) = \frac{10!}{7!} = 10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720
$$

### Combinations (OL/HL)

The number of ways to choose $r$ objects from $n$ distinct objects (order does not matter):

$$
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
$$

**Key identity:** $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$ (choosing $r$ to include equals choosing $n-r$ to
Exclude).

**Proof of $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$:**

$$
\binom{n}{n-r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!(n-(n-r))!} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!} = \binom{n}{r}
$$

**Example (OL):** How many ways to choose 4 students from a class of 15?

$$
\binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4! \cdot 11!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365
$$

### Arrangements with Repetition (HL)

The number of arrangements of $n$ objects where some objects are identical:

$$
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdots n_k!}
$$

Where $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ are the counts of each identical group.

**Example (HL):** How many arrangements of the word "STATISTICS"?

Total letters: 10. S appears 3 times, T appears 3 times, I appears 2 times.

$$
\frac{10!}{3! \cdot 3! \cdot 2!} = \frac{3628800}{6 \times 6 \times 2} = \frac{3628800}{72} = 50400
$$

### Pascal"s Triangle and Binomial Coefficients (HL)

Each entry in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two entries above it. The $r$Th entry in row $n$
Is $\binom{n}{r}$.

**Pascal's identity:** $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n-1}{r-1} + \binom{n-1}{r}$.

**Proof of Pascal's identity.** Consider choosing $r$ people from $n$ people. Fix one particular
Person, say Alice. Either Alice is chosen (leaving $\binom{n-1}{r-1}$ ways to choose the remaining
$r-1$ from $n-1$ others) or Alice is not chosen (leaving $\binom{n-1}{r}$ ways to choose all $r$
From $n-1$ others). These cases are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

**Binomial theorem:** $(a + b)^n = \sum_{r=0}^{n} \binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r$.

**Example (HL):** Find the coefficient of $x^3$ in the expansion of $(2x + 1)^7$.

$$
\binom{7}{3}(2x)^3(1)^4 = 35 \cdot 8x^3 = 280x^3
$$

So the coefficient is $280$.

## Probability

### Basic Probability (OL/HL)

For an event $A$:

$$
P(A) = \frac{\mathrm{number of favourable outcomes}{\mathrm{total number of outcomes}
$$

Properties: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$ and $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$.

**Axioms of probability (Kolmogorov):**

1. $P(A) \ge 0$ for any event $A$
2. $P(\Omega) = 1$ where $\Omega$ is the sample space
3. For mutually exclusive events $A_1, A_2, \ldots$:
   $P\!\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)$

### Rules of Probability (OL/HL)

**Addition rule:**

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

**Multiplication rule (independent events):**

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

Two events are **independent** if and only if $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$. This is not the same as
Mutually exclusive (which means $P(A \cap B) = 0$).

**Conditional probability:**

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

**Law of Total Probability (HL):** If $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n$ partition the sample space:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A | B_i)P(B_i)
$$

**Bayes' Theorem (HL):**

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

This is extremely important in real-world applications: medical testing, spam filtering, and machine
Learning all rely on Bayes' theorem.

**Extended Bayes' Theorem.** If $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n$ partition the sample space:

$$
P(B_i | A) = \frac{P(A | B_i)P(B_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(A | B_j)P(B_j)}
$$

**Example (HL):** A bag contains 4 red and 6 blue marbles. Two are drawn without replacement. Find
The probability both are red.

$$
P(\mathrm{both red) = \frac{4}{10} \times \frac{3}{9} = \frac{12}{90} = \frac{2}{15}
$$

**Example (HL) -- Bayes' theorem:** A test for a disease has 95% sensitivity (true positive rate)
And 2% false positive rate. The disease prevalence is 1%. Find the probability that a person who
Tests positive actually has the disease.

$P(D) = 0.01$$P(D') = 0.99$$P(+|D) = 0.95$$P(+|D') = 0.02$.

$$
P(D|+) = \frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.95 \times 0.01}{0.95 \times 0.01 + 0.02 \times 0.99} = \frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.0198} = \frac{0.0095}{0.0293} \approx 0.324
$$

Only about 32.4% of positive tests are true positives. This is the "base rate fallacy."

**Example (HL) -- Extended Bayes':** A factory has three machines producing bolts. Machine A
Produces 50% of bolts with 2% defect rate, Machine B produces 30% with 3% defect rate, Machine C
Produces 20% with 1% defect rate. A randomly selected bolt is defective. What is the probability it
Came from Machine B?

$$
P(B|\mathrm{def) = \frac{P(\mathrm{def|B)P(B)}{P(\mathrm{def|A)P(A) + P(\mathrm{def|B)P(B) + P(\mathrm{def|C)P(C)}
$$

$$
= \frac{0.03 \times 0.30}{0.02 \times 0.50 + 0.03 \times 0.30 + 0.01 \times 0.20} = \frac{0.009}{0.010 + 0.009 + 0.002} = \frac{0.009}{0.021} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.429
$$

### Probability Trees (OL)

A probability tree diagram is useful for multi-stage experiments.

**Example (OL):** A coin is tossed three times. Find the probability of getting exactly two heads.

There are $2^3 = 8$ equally likely outcomes. The favourable outcomes are HHT, HTH, THH.

$$
P(\mathrm{exactly 2 heads) = \frac{3}{8}
$$

Alternatively using combinations:

$$
P = \frac{\binom{3}{2}}{2^3} = \frac{3}{8}
$$

### Independence vs. Mutually Exclusive (HL)

These concepts are frequently confused:

| Property            | Independent                                 | Mutually Exclusive |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---- | ------- |
| Definition          | $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$                    | $P(A \cap B) = 0$  |
| Meaning             | Occurrence of one does not affect the other | Cannot both occur  |
| If $P(A), P(B) > 0$ | $P(A                                        | B) = P(A)$         | $P(A | B) = 0$ |

**Important:** If two events with positive probability are mutually exclusive, they cannot be
Independent (since $P(A \cap B) = 0 \neq P(A)P(B)$ when both probabilities are positive).

## Discrete Probability Distributions

### Expected Value (OL/HL)

For a random variable $X$ with values $x_i$ and probabilities $p_i$:

$$
E(X) = \sum x_i p_i
$$

**Variance:**

$$
\mathrm{Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 = \sum x_i^2 p_i - [E(X)]^2
$$

**Standard deviation:** $\sigma = \sqrt{\mathrm{Var(X)}$.

**Properties:**

- $E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b$
- $\mathrm{Var(aX + b) = a^2\mathrm{Var(X)$

**Proof of $\mathrm{Var(aX + b) = a^2\mathrm{Var(X)$:**

$$
\mathrm{Var(aX + b) = E[(aX + b)^2] - [E(aX + b)]^2
$$

$$
= E[a^2X^2 + 2abX + b^2] - [aE(X) + b]^2
$$

$$
= a^2E(X^2) + 2abE(X) + b^2 - a^2[E(X)]^2 - 2abE(X) - b^2
$$

$$
= a^2[E(X^2) - (E(X))^2] = a^2\mathrm{Var(X)
$$

**Example (OL):** A fair die is rolled. Find $E(X)$ and $\mathrm{Var(X)$.

$$
E(X) = \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5
$$

$$
E(X^2) = \frac{1+4+9+16+25+36}{6} = \frac{91}{6}
$$

$$
\mathrm{Var(X) = \frac{91}{6} - \frac{49}{4} = \frac{182 - 147}{12} = \frac{35}{12} \approx 2.917
$$

### Binomial Distribution (HL)

$X \sim \mathrm{Bin(n, p)$ where $n$ is the number of trials and $p$ is the probability of success.

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

$$
E(X) = np, \quad \mathrm{Var(X) = np(1-p)
$$

**Conditions:** fixed $n$Independent trials, two outcomes, constant $p$.

**Proof that $E(X) = np$ for $X \sim \mathrm{Bin(n, p)$.** Let $X_i$ be the indicator variable for
Success on trial $i$ (so $X_i = 1$ with probability $p$$X_i = 0$ with probability $1-p$). Then
$X = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n$ and $E(X_i) = p$ So $E(X) = np$.

**Example (HL):** A multiple-choice test has 20 questions, each with 4 options. A student guesses
Every answer. Find the probability of getting exactly 5 correct.

$$
X \sim \mathrm{Bin(20, 0.25)
$$

$$
P(X = 5) = \binom{20}{5}(0.25)^5(0.75)^{15} \approx 0.2023
$$

### Poisson Distribution (HL)

$X \sim \mathrm{Po(\lambda)$ models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval when events
Happen independently at a constant average rate $\lambda$.

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
$$

$$
E(X) = \lambda, \quad \mathrm{Var(X) = \lambda
$$

**Conditions:** events occur independently, at a constant average rate, and singly (not in
Clusters).

**Example (HL):** A call centre receives an average of 4.5 calls per minute. Find the probability of
Receiving exactly 3 calls in a given minute.

$$
X \sim \mathrm{Po(4.5)
$$

$$
P(X = 3) = \frac{e^{-4.5}(4.5)^3}{3!} = \frac{e^{-4.5} \times 91.125}{6} \approx \frac{0.01111 \times 91.125}{6} \approx 0.1687
$$

**Example (HL):** Using the same call centre, find $P(X \le 2)$.

$$
P(X \le 2) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) = e^{-4.5}\left(1 + 4.5 + \frac{4.5^2}{2}\right) = e^{-4.5}(1 + 4.5 + 10.125) = 15.625 \times e^{-4.5} \approx 0.1736
$$

### Normal Distribution (HL)

$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The standard normal $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$ has $Z \sim N(0, 1)$.

**Empirical rule (68-95-99.7):**

- $P(\mu - \sigma \lt X \lt \mu + \sigma) \approx 68.27\%$
- $P(\mu - 2\sigma \lt X \lt \mu + 2\sigma) \approx 95.45\%$
- $P(\mu - 3\sigma \lt X \lt \mu + 3\sigma) \approx 99.73\%$

**Why the normal distribution is special.** The Central Limit Theorem states that the mean of a
Large number of independent random variables is approximately normally distributed, regardless of
The original distribution. This is why the normal distribution appears everywhere in nature.

**Example (HL):** Exam marks are normally distributed with $\mu = 60$$\sigma = 10$. Find the
Probability a student scores above 75.

$$
P(X > 75) = P\left(Z > \frac{75 - 60}{10}\right) = P(Z > 1.5) \approx 0.0668
$$

### Normal Approximation to the Binomial (HL)

When $np \ge 5$ and $n(1-p) \ge 5$:

$$
X \sim \mathrm{Bin(n, p) \approx N(np, np(1-p))
$$

Apply a **continuity correction**:
$P(X \le k) \approx P\!\left(Z \lt \frac{k + 0.5 - np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}\right)$.

**Why continuity correction is needed.** The binomial is discrete (defined on integers) while the
Normal is continuous. Without the correction, we would compute $P(X \le 5) = P(X \lt 6)$ But the
Normal approximation for $P(X \lt 5)$ would miss the entire bar at $X = 5$.

### Bernoulli Trials (HL)

A Bernoulli trial is a single experiment with two outcomes: success (probability $p$) and failure
(probability $1-p$). The binomial distribution models $n$ independent Bernoulli trials.

## Statistical Measures

### Measures of Central Tendency (OL/HL)

**Mean:** $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$

**Median:** The middle value when data is arranged in order.

**Mode:** The most frequently occurring value.

### Measures of Spread (OL/HL)

**Range:** $\mathrm{Range = \mathrm{maximum - \mathrm{minimum$

**Interquartile range (IQR):** $\mathrm{IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$

**Standard deviation:**

$$
S = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}}
$$

**Computational formula:**

$$
S = \sqrt{\frac{\sum x_i^2}{n} - \bar{x}^2}
$$

### Grouped Data (OL/HL)

For grouped data with class midpoints $x_i$ and frequencies $f_i$:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum f_i x_i}{\sum f_i}
$$

$$
S = \sqrt{\frac{\sum f_i x_i^2}{\sum f_i} - \bar{x}^2}
$$

### Box Plots (HL)

A box plot displays five statistics: minimum, $Q_1$Median, $Q_3$Maximum.

**Outlier:** A value below $Q_1 - 1.5 \times \mathrm{IQR$ or above $Q_3 + 1.5 \times \mathrm{IQR$.

**Example (HL):** A data set has $Q_1 = 25$$Q_3 = 45$Minimum $= 10$Maximum $= 65$. Identify Any
outliers.

$\mathrm{IQR = 45 - 25 = 20$.

Lower fence: $25 - 1.5(20) = -5$. Since the minimum is $10 > -5$No low outliers.

Upper fence: $45 + 1.5(20) = 75$. Since the maximum is $65 < 75$No high outliers.

### Skewness (HL)

- **Positive skew:** Mean > Median (right tail is longer). The mode is less than the median.
- **Negative skew:** Mean < Median (left tail is longer). The mode is greater than the median.
- **Symmetric:** Mean = Median.

In a box plot, positive skew means the right whisker is longer; negative skew means the left whisker
Is longer.

## Hypothesis Testing (HL)

### Steps

1. State the null hypothesis $H_0$ and the alternative hypothesis $H_1$.
2. Choose the significance level $\alpha$ ( 5%).
3. Calculate the test statistic.
4. Determine the critical value(s) or p-value.
5. Compare and make a decision.
6. State the conclusion in context.

### One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests (HL)

| Feature         | One-tailed             | Two-tailed              |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| $H_1$           | $p > p_0$ or $p < p_0$ | $p \neq p_0$            |
| Critical region | One tail only          | Both tails              |
| Critical value  | $z_{1-\alpha}$         | $z_{1-\alpha/2}$        |
| p-value         | One tail area          | Two tail areas combined |

### z-test for a Proportion (HL)

**Example:** A coin is tossed 200 times and lands on heads 115 times. Test at the 5% significance
Level whether the coin is biased.

$H_0: p = 0.5$ (coin is fair), $H_1: p \neq 0.5$ (coin is biased).

Under $H_0$: $\mu = np = 100$$\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{50} \approx 7.071$.

Using the normal approximation with continuity correction:
$Z = \frac{114.5 - 100}{7.071} \approx 2.05$.

Critical values at $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed): $z = \pm 1.96$.

Since $2.05 > 1.96$We reject $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence to suggest the coin is biased.

### t-test for a Mean (HL)

When the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small ($n < 30$), use the
T-distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom.

$$
T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

**Example (HL):** A sample of 8 measurements has $\bar{x} = 23.4$ and $s = 2.1$. Test at the 5%
Level whether the population mean is 25.

$H_0: \mu = 25$$H_1: \mu \neq 25$.

$$
T = \frac{23.4 - 25}{2.1/\sqrt{8}} = \frac{-1.6}{0.7423} \approx -2.156
$$

Degrees of freedom $= 7$. The critical value from t-tables at $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed, 7 df) is
Approximately $\pm 2.365$.

Since $|-2.156| = 2.156 < 2.365$We do not reject $H_0$. There is insufficient evidence to conclude
The population mean differs from 25.

### Type I and Type II Errors (HL)

| Error Type | Description                                 | Probability |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Type I     | Rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true          | $\alpha$    |
| Type II    | Failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false | $\beta$     |

The **power** of a test is $1 - \beta$: the probability of correctly rejecting a false $H_0$.

### Confidence Intervals (HL)

A 95% confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is known:

$$
\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

When $\sigma$ is unknown (use sample standard deviation $s$ with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom):

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{n-1,\, 0.025} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

**Interpretation:** If we were to take many samples and construct a 95% confidence interval from
Each, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean. It does NOT mean
There is a 95% probability that $\mu$ lies in any particular interval.

## Correlation and Regression (HL)

### Scatter Plots and Correlation

A **scatter plot** displays pairs of data points. The **Pearson correlation coefficient** $r$
Measures linear association:

$$
R = \frac{n\sum xy - \sum x \sum y}{\sqrt{[n\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2][n\sum y^2 - (\sum y)^2]}}
$$

$-1 \le r \le 1$. Values near $\pm 1$ indicate strong linear correlation. $r = 0$ means no linear
Correlation (but there may be a non-linear relationship).

**Important:** Correlation does not imply causation.

### Coefficient of Determination (HL)

The coefficient of determination $r^2$ represents the proportion of variance in $y$ explained by the
Linear relationship with $x$.

If $r = 0.8$ Then $r^2 = 0.64$Meaning 64% of the variation in $y$ is accounted for by the linear
Regression on $x$. The remaining 36% is due to other factors.

### Line of Best Fit (Least Squares) (HL)

The regression line of $y$ on $x$ is:

$$
Y = a + bx
$$

Where:

$$
B = \frac{n\sum xy - \sum x \sum y}{n\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2}, \quad a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x}
$$

The least squares line minimises $\sum(y_i - (a + bx_i))^2$.

**Example (HL):** For the data set $\{(1,3), (2,5), (3,4), (4,7), (5,6)\}$Find the correlation
Coefficient and regression line.

$n = 5$$\sum x = 15$$\sum y = 25$$\sum xy = 1(3)+2(5)+3(4)+4(7)+5(6) = 3+10+12+28+30 = 83$
$\sum x^2 = 1+4+9+16+25 = 55$$\sum y^2 = 9+25+16+49+36 = 135$.

$$
R = \frac{5(83) - 15(25)}{\sqrt{[5(55) - 225][5(135) - 625]}} = \frac{415 - 375}{\sqrt{[275 - 225][675 - 625]}} = \frac{40}{\sqrt{50 \times 50}} = \frac{40}{50} = 0.8
$$

$$
B = \frac{40}{50} = 0.8, \quad a = \frac{25}{5} - 0.8 \times \frac{15}{5} = 5 - 2.4 = 2.6
$$

Regression line: $y = 0.8x + 2.6$.

$r^2 = 0.64$: 64% of the variation in $y$ is explained by the linear relationship with $x$.

**Warning:** The regression line of $y$ on $x$ should only be used for prediction within the range
Of the data (interpolation). Extrapolation beyond the data range is unreliable.

## Intuition

Probability is the mathematics of uncertainty -- it quantifies how likely events are and helps you make decisions when you cannot be sure of the outcome. The key rules (addition, multiplication, conditional probability) are like the grammar of uncertainty: they tell you how to combine chances in different situations. Statistics is the science of drawing conclusions from data -- the mean tells you the centre, the standard deviation tells you the spread, and hypothesis testing tells you whether an observed effect is real or just noise. The most important insight is that correlation does not imply causation -- two things can happen together without one causing the other.

## Worked Examples

See the examples integrated throughout the sections above.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing permutations and combinations** -- order matters for permutations, not for
   combinations. Ask: "Is `\{A,B,C\}` the same as `\{C,B,A\}`?"
2. **Forgetting independence** in the multiplication rule -- always check whether events are
   independent before using $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
3. **Normal distribution** -- always standardise before using tables. $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$.
4. **Hypothesis testing** -- state $H_0$ and $H_1$ before computing. The conclusion must address the
   original question in context.
5. **Binomial vs normal** -- use the binomial for discrete counts and normal for continuous
   measurements. Use the normal approximation only when the conditions are met.
6. **Continuity correction** -- when approximating a binomial with a normal, apply a continuity
   correction (e.g., $P(X \le 5) \approx P(X < 5.5)$).
7. **Base rate fallacy** -- in Bayes' theorem problems, the prior probability matters enormously. A
   test with 99% accuracy can still have a low positive predictive value if the condition is rare.
8. **Confusing independence with mutual exclusivity** -- mutually exclusive events with positive
   probability are never independent.
9. **Forgetting to check conditions** for the Poisson distribution -- events must occur
   independently at a constant rate.
10. **Interpreting confidence intervals incorrectly** -- a 95% CI does not mean there is a 95%
    probability that $\mu$ lies in the interval.

### 8.4 Poisson Approximation to the Binomial

When $n$ is large, $p$ is small, and $np$ is moderate, the binomial distribution can be approximated
By a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = np$:

$$
\mathrm{Bin(n, p) \approx \mathrm{Po(np)
$$

This avoids calculating large binomial coefficients. As a rule of thumb, the approximation is good
When $n \ge 50$ and $p \le 0.1$.

**Example (HL):** A machine produces items with a defect rate of 2%. In a batch of 200 items, find
The probability of at most 3 defects using the Poisson approximation.

$\lambda = np = 200 \times 0.02 = 4$.

$$
P(X \le 3) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) = e^{-4}\left(1 + 4 + \frac{16}{2} + \frac{64}{6}\right) = e^{-4}(1 + 4 + 8 + 10.667) = 23.667 \times e^{-4} \approx 0.4335
$$

### 8.5 Choosing the Right Distribution

| Distribution | When to use                                        | Parameters      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Binomial     | Fixed number of trials, two outcomes, constant $p$ | $n, p$          |
| Poisson      | Events occur at constant rate, independently       | $\lambda$       |
| Normal       | Continuous data, symmetric bell shape              | $\mu, \sigma^2$ |

:::tip
If it mentions "out of $n$ trials," think Binomial.

### 8.6 Relationship Between Distributions

The three main distributions covered in this topic are connected:

- **Binomial to Normal:** When $n$ is large and $p$ is not too close to 0 or 1,
  $\mathrm{Bin(n,p) \approx N(np, np(1-p))$.
- **Binomial to Poisson:** When $n$ is large and $p$ is small,
  $\mathrm{Bin(n,p) \approx \mathrm{Po(np)$.
- **Poisson to Normal:** When $\lambda$ is large ( $\lambda > 15$),
  $\mathrm{Po(\lambda) \approx N(\lambda, \lambda)$.

### 8.7 Law of Large Numbers (HL - awareness)

The law of large numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the sample mean converges to
The expected value. Formally, for i.i.d. Random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ with mean $\mu$:

$$
\bar{X}_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n} \to \mu \mathrm{ as  n \to \infty
$$

This is why a coin tossed many times gives a proportion of heads close to 0.5, even if short
Sequences may deviate significantly.
