## Systemd Architecture

Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, serving as the init system (PID 1) and providing
A suite of tools for managing services, devices, mounts, timers, and more. It replaced the
Traditional SysV init system and is used by default on virtually every major Linux distribution.

    A --> K[udevd - Device Manager]
    A --> L[resolved - DNS Resolver]
    A --> M[Networkd - Network Manager]
    A --> N[timesyncd - NTP Client]
```

### Design Principles

- **Socket activation**: Services are started on-demand when a connection arrives on their socket,
  reducing boot time and resource usage.
- **Parallel startup**: Dependencies are resolved, and services without dependencies start in
  parallel.
- **Unit-based configuration**: Everything managed by systemd is represented as a "unit" with a
  declarative configuration file.
- **Cgroup tracking**: Each service runs in its own cgroup, making resource management and cleanup
  reliable.
- **Journal**: Structured logging with indexed, searchable log data.

## Unit Types

A **unit** is the fundamental object that systemd manages. Each unit has a configuration file and a
Type that determines its behavior.

| Unit Type     | File Extension | Description                                |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Service**   | `.service`     | A system service (daemon or one-shot)      |
| **Target**    | `.target`      | A synchronization point for grouping units |
| **Timer**     | `.timer`       | A timer for activating other units         |
| **Socket**    | `.socket`      | A socket for socket activation             |
| **Mount**     | `.mount`       | A file system mount point                  |
| **Automount** | `.automount`   | An automount point (mount on access)       |
| **Path**      | `.path`        | A path for path-based activation           |
| **Slice**     | `.slice`       | A cgroup slice for resource management     |
| **Scope**     | `.scope`       | An externally created process group        |
| **Swap**      | `.swap`        | A swap device                              |
| **Device**    | `.device`      | A kernel device                            |

### Finding Unit Files

Systemd searches for unit files in several directories, with later directories overriding earlier
Ones:

```bash
# Show the search path
systemctl show -p UnitPath

# Typical search order:
# 1. /etc/systemd/system/          (administrator overrides)
# 2. /run/systemd/system/          (runtime configuration)
# 3. /usr/lib/systemd/system/      (package-installed units)
```

### Viewing Units

```bash
# List all installed unit files
systemctl list-unit-files

# List all active units
systemctl list-units

# List all active services
systemctl list-units --type=service

# List failed units
systemctl --failed

# List timers
systemctl list-timers --all

# Show unit configuration
systemctl cat nginx.service

# Show unit properties
systemctl show nginx.service

# Show specific property
systemctl show nginx.service -p ExecStart
systemctl show nginx.service -p CPUUsageNSec
systemctl show nginx.service -p MemoryCurrent

# Check unit dependencies
systemctl list-dependencies nginx.service
systemctl list-dependencies nginx.service --reverse

# Check what requires a target
systemctl list-dependencies multi-user.target --reverse
```

## Service Unit Files

A `.service` file defines how a service is started, stopped, and managed. The file consists of
Sections in INI-style format.

### `[Unit]` Section

| Directive       | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Description`   | Human-readable description                                  |
| `Documentation` | URL to documentation                                        |
| `After=`        | Start after the listed units (ordering, not dependency)     |
| `Before=`       | Start before the listed units                               |
| `Requires=`     | Hard dependency — if the listed unit fails, this unit fails |
| `Wants=`        | Soft dependency — start if available, continue if not       |
| `Requisite=`    | Hard dependency — fail immediately if not already running   |
| `Conflicts=`    | If the listed unit is running, this unit cannot start       |
| `PartOf=`       | When the listed unit is stopped/restarted, this unit is too |

### `[Service]` Section — Service Type

| Type               | Behavior                                                                              | Use Case                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `simple` (default) | `ExecStart` is the main process. Systemd considers it started immediately.            | Most daemons                  |
| `exec`             | `ExecStart` is the main process. Systemd waits for it to fork and exit.               | Daemons that double-fork      |
| `forking`          | `ExecStart` forks a child and the parent exits. Systemd waits for the parent to exit. | Traditional daemons           |
| `oneshot`          | `ExecStart` runs and exits. Systemd waits for it to finish.                           | Scripts, initialization tasks |
| `dbus`             | Service acquires a name on D-Bus. Systemd considers it started when the name appears. | D-Bus services                |
| `notify`           | Service sends `sd_notify()` when ready. Systemd waits for the notification.           | Modern daemons with sd_notify |
| `notify-reload`    | Like `notify`But supports `sd_notify(RELOADING=1)` for reload.                        | Daemons with reload support   |
| `idle`             | Like `simple`But started after all active jobs are dispatched.                        | Avoids blocking boot output   |

### `[Service]` Section — Lifecycle Directives

```ini
[Service]
# Main process
ExecStart=/usr/bin/myapp --config /etc/myapp/config.yaml

# Pre-start check
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/myapp --validate-config

# Post-start (runs after ExecStart)
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/touch /var/run/myapp/initialized

# Reload (sent on systemctl reload)
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

# Stop (default: SIGTERM)
ExecStop=/usr/bin/myapp --shutdown

# Stop post-cleanup
ExecStopPost=/bin/rm -f /var/run/myapp/initialized

# Environment
Environment="NODE_ENV=production"
Environment="LOG_LEVEL=info"
EnvironmentFile=/etc/myapp/environment

# Pass environment file (allows variable expansion)
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/myapp/env.local    # - means file is optional
```

### `[Service]` Section — Restart Policy

| Directive             | Behavior                                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Restart=no`          | Never restart (default)                              |
| `Restart=on-success`  | Restart if the process exits cleanly (exit code 0)   |
| `Restart=on-failure`  | Restart if the process exits with non-zero or signal |
| `Restart=on-abnormal` | Restart on signal, timeout, or watchdog              |
| `Restart=on-abort`    | Restart on signal (not clean exit)                   |
| `Restart=on-watchdog` | Restart on watchdog timeout                          |
| `Restart=always`      | Always restart, regardless of exit status            |

```ini
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5              # wait 5 seconds between restarts
StartLimitBurst=5         # allow 5 restarts within...
StartLimitIntervalSec=60  # ...60 seconds before giving up
```

### `systemctl` — Service Management

```bash
# Start/stop/restart
systemctl start nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl restart nginx

# Reload configuration (sends SIGHUP or uses ExecReload)
systemctl reload nginx

# Reload daemon configuration (after editing unit files)
systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable/disable (start on boot)
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl disable nginx

# Enable and start in one command
systemctl enable --now nginx

# Check status
systemctl status nginx

# Check if a service is active
systemctl is-active nginx        # outputs: active / inactive / failed

# Check if enabled at boot
systemctl is-enabled nginx       # outputs: enabled / disabled

# Edit unit file (opens override file)
systemctl edit nginx             # creates /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/override.conf

# Edit the full unit file
systemctl edit --full nginx      # copies to /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service

# Show service logs
journalctl -u nginx
journalctl -u nginx -f           # follow (like tail -f)
journalctl -u nginx --since "1 hour ago"
journalctl -u nginx --since "2024-01-01" --until "2024-01-02"

# Show service cgroup resource usage
systemctl status nginx
systemctl show nginx -p MemoryCurrent
systemctl show nginx -p CPUUsageNSec
systemctl show nginx -p TasksCurrent

# Reset failed state
systemctl reset-failed nginx

# Mask/unmask (prevent a service from starting, even manually)
systemctl mask nginx
systemctl unmask nginx
```

## Targets

Targets are synchronization points that group units. They replace the SysV runlevel concept.

### Target Equivalents to Runlevels

| SysV Runlevel | systemd Target      | Description                   |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 0             | `poweroff.target`   | Halt/shutdown                 |
| 1             | `rescue.target`     | Single-user mode              |
| 2, 4          | `multi-user.target` | Multi-user, no GUI            |
| 3             | `multi-user.target` | Multi-user, no GUI            |
| 5             | `graphical.target`  | Multi-user with GUI           |
| 6             | `reboot.target`     | Reboot                        |
| —             | `emergency.target`  | Emergency shell               |
| —             | `default.target`    | Symlink to the default target |

```bash
# View current target
systemctl get-default

# Set default target
systemctl set-default multi-user.target

# Change target (switch runlevel)
systemctl isolate multi-user.target

# List active targets
systemctl list-units --type=target
```

### Custom Targets

```bash
# Create a custom target
systemctl add-wants multi-user.target myapp.target

# Create a unit file for the target
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp.target
[Unit]
Description=My Application Stack
Requires=myapp.service redis.service postgresql.service
After=myapp.service redis.service postgresql.service
```

## Journal (journald)

`systemd-journald` is the logging daemon that collects and stores log messages from the kernel,
Systemd units, and standard output/error of services.

### Journalctl Usage

```bash
# Show all logs (newest first)
journalctl

# Show boot logs
journalctl -b              # current boot
journalctl -b -1           # previous boot
journalctl -b -5           # five boots ago
journalctl --list-boots    # list all boots with timestamps

# Filter by unit
journalctl -u nginx
journalctl -u nginx -u php-fpm    # multiple units

# Filter by time
journalctl --since "2024-01-15 10:00:00"
journalctl --since "2 hours ago"
journalctl --since yesterday
journalctl --until "2024-01-15 12:00:00"

# Filter by priority
journalctl -p err          # error and above
journalctl -p warning      # warning and above
journalctl -p debug        # all messages

# Priority levels: emerg(0), alert(1), crit(2), err(3), warning(4), notice(5), info(6), debug(7)

# Filter by process
journalctl _PID=1234
journalctl _COMM=nginx
journalctl _UID=33

# Output format
journalctl -o json         # JSON
journalctl -o json-pretty  # pretty JSON
journalctl -o verbose      # full metadata
journalctl -o cat          # just the message (no metadata)

# Follow live logs
journalctl -f
journalctl -u nginx -f

# Show disk usage
journalctl --disk-usage

# Vacuum logs (free space)
journalctl --vacuum-size=500M
journalctl --vacuum-time=30d
journalctl --vacuum-files=10

# Export to syslog format
journalctl -o syslog

# Kernel messages
journalctl -k
```

### Journal Configuration

```ini
# /etc/systemd/journald.conf
[Journal]
Storage=auto              # auto, persistent, volatile, none
Compress=yes              # compress log entries
Seal=yes                  # forward-secure sealing (FSSEC)
SystemMaxUse=500M         # max disk space for system journal
SystemKeepFree=1G         # keep at least 1G free
SystemMaxFileSize=50M     # max size per journal file
MaxRetentionSec=30day     # keep logs for 30 days
MaxFileSec=1week          # rotate weekly
ForwardToSyslog=yes       # also forward to traditional syslog
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Does not exist, logs are stored in `/run/log/journal/` (volatile — lost on reboot). Ensure
`/var/log/journal/` exists and has correct permissions (`systemd-tmpfiles --create`).

## Timers

Systemd timers replace cron for scheduled tasks. They support one-shot and recurring timers with
More precise scheduling than cron.

### Timer Unit File

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/backup.timer
[Unit]
Description=Daily Backup Timer

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 03:00:00
Persistent=yes          # if the timer was missed (system off), run at next boot
RandomizedDelaySec=300  # random delay up to 5 minutes (avoid thundering herd)
Unit=backup.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/backup.service
[Unit]
Description=Daily Backup

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/opt/scripts/backup.sh
User=backup
```

### Timer Schedule Formats

```bash
# Timer calendar format
# OnCalendar=day-of-week year-month-day hour:minute:second

OnCalendar=*-*-* 03:00:00          # daily at 3 AM
OnCalendar=Mon *-*-* 03:00:00      # weekly on Monday
OnCalendar=*-*-* 03:00:00          # daily at 3 AM
OnCalendar=Mon,Fri *-*-* 17:30:00  # Monday and Friday at 5:30 PM
OnCalendar=*-*-01 03:00:00         # 1st of every month
OnCalendar=*-*~03 03:00:00         # every day except the 3rd
OnCalendar=hourly                  # every hour
OnCalendar=weekly                  # every Monday at 00:00
OnCalendar=monthly                 # 1st of every month at 00:00
OnCalendar=Sat,Sun *-*-* 02,14:00:00  # Sat/Sun at 2 AM and 2 PM

# Validate a timer expression
systemd-analyze calendar "*-*-* 03:00:00'
systemd-analyze calendar 'Mon *-*-* 03:00:00'
```

### Managing Timers

```bash
# List all timers
systemctl list-timers --all

# List timers with unit files
systemctl list-timers --all --no-pager

# Start/stop/enable timers
systemctl start backup.timer
systemctl enable --now backup.timer

# Check next run time
systemctl show backup.timer -p NextElapseUSecMonotonic

# Timer vs cron comparison
# - Timers support monotonic time (boot-relative)
# - Timers support missed job catchup (Persistent=yes)
# - Timers have built-in logging
# - Timers support dependencies
# - Timers can be triggered by events (path, socket)
```

### Monotonic Timers

Monotonic timers are relative to a system event (boot, service start, etc.) rather than wall-clock
Time:

```ini
# Run 5 minutes after boot
OnBootSec=5min

# Run 30 seconds after the timer unit is activated
OnActiveSec=30s

# Run 1 hour after the service was last started
OnUnitActiveSec=1h
```

## Socket Activation

Socket activation allows systemd to defer starting a service until a client connects to its socket.
This reduces boot time and resource usage.

### Socket Unit File

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp.socket
[Unit]
Description=My Application Socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/myapp.sock
ListenStream=8080
Accept=no              # systemd accepts connections and passes to service

# Or with Accept=yes (each connection spawns a new service instance):
# Accept=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
[Unit]
Description=My Application
Requires=myapp.socket

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/myapp
StandardInput=socket
StandardOutput=socket
```

```bash
# List active sockets
systemctl list-sockets

# Enable socket activation
systemctl enable --now myapp.socket

# Check which socket a service uses
systemctl list-sockets | grep myapp
```

## Service Hardening

Systemd provides a comprehensive set of directives for restricting what a service can do. These are
The primary mechanism for securing systemd-managed services.

### Filesystem Restrictions

| Directive              | Effect                                           |

| `BindReadOnlyPaths=`   | Mount paths read-only into service namespace     |
| `BindPaths=`           | Mount paths read-write into service namespace    |

### Process and Capability Restrictions

| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes` | Deny creating writable+executable memory         |
| `LockPersonality=yes`        | Lock the execution domain (personality)          |

### Security Analysis

```bash
# Analyze service security
systemd-analyze security nginx.service

# Output includes a security score (0-10, lower is better)
# and specific recommendations for improvement

# Analyze all running services
systemd-analyze security --no-pager

# Verify service configuration
systemd-analyze verify myapp.service
```

## System vs User Services

Systemd manages two categories of services:

| Aspect            | System Services                    | User Services                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **PID 1 scope**   | Managed by system systemd (PID 1)  | Managed by per-user systemd instance |
| **File location** | `/etc/systemd/system/`             | `~/.config/systemd/user/`            |
| **Manages**       | System daemons, hardware           | User applications, session services  |
| **Run as**        | Any user ( root)                   | The user who started them            |
| **Lifespan**      | System-wide, from boot to shutdown | From login to logout (or linger)     |

```bash
# User service management (note --user flag)
systemctl --user start myapp.service
systemctl --user enable myapp.service
systemctl --user status myapp.service

# Enable lingering (user services run without active login)
loginctl enable-linger username

# Check user services
systemctl --user list-units
systemctl --user list-timers
```

## Boot Analysis

```bash
# Analyze boot time
systemd-analyze

# Analyze boot time with blame (time per service)
systemd-analyze blame

# Critical chain (dependency chain that took longest)
systemd-analyze critical-chain

# Critical chain for a specific target
systemd-analyze critical-chain multi-user.target

# Generate SVG boot chart
systemd-analyze plot > /tmp/boot.svg

# Verify unit files (check for errors)
systemd-analyze verify
systemd-analyze verify myapp.service
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Forgetting `daemon-reload` After Editing Unit Files

After editing a `.service` file, you must reload the systemd daemon before changes take effect:

```bash
systemctl edit nginx
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart nginx
```

### Pitfall: `Type=forking` Without `PIDFile`

If a service is declared as `Type=forking` but does not specify a `PIDFile=`Systemd cannot Reliably
track the main process. It may think the service started successfully when the parent Exited, but
the actual daemon failed to start:

```ini
# Always specify PIDFile for forking services
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/myapp/myapp.pid
```

### Pitfall: Service Cannot Write to Protected Paths

When `ProtectSystem=strict` is set, the service cannot write to most of the filesystem. Use
`ReadWritePaths=` to explicitly allow write access:

```ini
ProtectSystem=strict
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/myapp /var/log/myapp
```

### Pitfall: Timer Not Firing

Common reasons timers do not fire:

1. The timer unit is not enabled: `systemctl enable --now myapp.timer`
2. The `Persistent=yes` option is missing (missed runs during downtime are lost)
3. The system clock is wrong (timers use wall-clock time by default)
4. The timer is in a failed state: `systemctl reset-failed myapp.timer`

```bash
# Debug a timer
systemctl status myapp.timer
systemctl list-timers --all | grep myapp
journalctl -u myapp.timer --since "1 day ago"
```

### Pitfall: `Restart=always` Causing Boot Loops

If a service fails immediately on start and `Restart=always` is set with a very short `RestartSec`
The service will enter a rapid restart loop. Use `StartLimitBurst` and `StartLimitIntervalSec` to
Prevent this:

```ini
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StartLimitBurst=5
StartLimitIntervalSec=300
```

### Pitfall: Logging to Files Instead of Journal

Services that log to files directly (via `fopen` or redirecting stdout to a file) bypass the
Journal. This means:

- Logs are not indexed or searchable with `journalctl`
- Log rotation must be managed separately
- Log metadata (PID, unit, timestamps) is not captured

**Fix**: Let services log to stdout/stderr (the default) and let journald handle storage. Use
`StandardOutput=journal`.

### Pitfall: `EnvironmentFile` and Variable Expansion

`EnvironmentFile` reads a file of `KEY=VALUE` pairs. It does **not** perform shell variable
Expansion. If you need expansion, use `ExecStart` with a shell wrapper or use `${VARIABLE}` in
`ExecStart` (systemd performs its own expansion for `%i``%n`Etc.):

```ini
# This works — systemd expands %n, %i, %f, etc.
ExecStart=/usr/bin/app --config /etc/%i/config.yaml

# This does NOT work — EnvironmentFile does not expand variables
EnvironmentFile=/etc/myapp/${HOSTNAME}.env

# Use ExecStartPre to set up dynamic environment
ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c 'echo "HOSTNAME=$(hostname)" > /run/myapp/env'
EnvironmentFile=/run/myapp/env
```

### Pitfall: Order vs Dependency

`After=` and `Before=` control **ordering** (when to start relative to other units), not
**dependency** (whether to start at all). If you need the dependency, use `Requires=` or `Wants=` in
Addition:

```ini
# WRONG — only ordering, no dependency
After=postgresql.service

# CORRECT — both ordering and dependency
After=postgresql.service
Wants=postgresql.service
```

## Summary

This topic covers the core concepts of systemd, including underlying theory, practical
implementation, and key applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- TCP/IP and the OSI model
- network topologies
- protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
- encryption and security
- client-server and peer-to-peer

Understanding these concepts thoroughly is essential for both examinations and practical
programming, and requires both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice.

## Worked Examples

Worked examples demonstrating the application of key concepts are covered in the detailed sub-pages
linked above.

## Intuition

Processes are programs in execution, each with its own memory space and priority. Systemd manages the lifecycle of services, starting them at boot and restarting them if they fail. Understanding process states (running, sleeping, stopped, zombie) helps you diagnose why a service is not responding. Signals like SIGTERM and SIGKILL provide graceful and forceful ways to control processes.
