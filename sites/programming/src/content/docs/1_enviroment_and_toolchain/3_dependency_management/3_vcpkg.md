**vcpkg** is Microsoft's cross-platform package manager. While originally designed with an
Imperative, global installation model ("Classic Mode"), modern C++ architecture relies on **Manifest
Mode**.

Manifest Mode shifts dependency management from a system-level state to a project-level state. It
Utilizes a declarative JSON file (`vcpkg.json`) to define the dependency graph, ensuring that
Checking out a repository at a specific commit guarantees the exact reproduction of the build
Environment, including all third-party library versions.

## 1. The Manifest Architecture (`vcpkg.json`)

The core of this architecture is the manifest file located at the project root. It serves a role
Analogous to `Cargo.toml` in Rust or `package.json` in Node.js, but with mechanics adapted for C++
ABI constraints.

### Complete Manifest Example

```json
{
  "name": "high-perf-system",
  "version-string": "1.0.0",
  "description": "High-performance data processing system",
  "builtin-baseline": "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abc",
  "dependencies": [
    "fmt",
    "nlohmann-json",
    "spdlog",
    {
      "name": "asio",
      "version>=": "1.24.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "gtest",
      "host": true
    },
    {
      "name": "protobuf",
      "host": true,
      "default-features": false,
      "features": ["protoc"]
    }
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "name": "fmt",
      "version": "10.1.1"
    }
  ],
  "features": {
    "networking": {
      "description": "Networking support via asio",
      "dependencies": ["asio"]
    },
    "testing": {
      "description": "Testing support via gtest",
      "dependencies": ["gtest"]
    }
  },
  "vcpkg-configuration": {
    "default-registry": {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg",
      "baseline": "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abc"
    }
  }
}
```

### Architectural Components

1. **Builtin-Baseline:** vcpkg does not resolve versions by checking the "latest" available on the
   server. Instead, it uses a **Baseline**, which is a specific Git commit SHA of the vcpkg
   repository. The baseline defines a snapshot of the entire C++ ecosystem that is known to compile
   together.
2. **Dependencies:** Simple strings denote the package name. The version is implicitly determined by
   the baseline.
3. **Constraints (`version>=`):** These enforce a minimum version. If the baseline provides an older
   version, vcpkg upgrades.
4. **Host Dependencies:** The `"host": true` flag indicates a tool required for the build process
   itself (e.g., `protobuf` compiler) rather than a library to link against. This allows
   cross-compilation where the build host (x64) runs tools to generate code for the target (ARM64).
5. **Overrides:** These force a specific version, bypassing the baseline logic. This is commonly
   used to pin exact versions or temporarily revert a broken update.
6. **Features:** Named groups of dependencies that can be optionally installed. Enable with
   `--x-feature=networking`.
7. **Features on dependencies:** Control which features of a dependency are built. This reduces
   compile time by excluding unused functionality.

### Baseline Mechanics

The baseline is the foundational version pinning mechanism. When you specify a baseline commit:

1. Vcpkg checks out that exact commit of its own repository.
2. For each dependency, vcpkg reads the `versions/<baseline>/<package>/baseline.json` file at that
   commit, which specifies the exact version of the package.
3. All packages are built at the versions specified by the baseline, ensuring a known-good
   combination.

If you need to update a dependency, you either change the baseline (updating all dependencies to the
New baseline's versions) or use an override to pin a specific package to a different version.

## 2. Registry Federation

Large-scale systems often require dependencies not present in the public Microsoft registry, such as
Proprietary internal libraries or forks of open-source projects. **Registry Federation** allows a
Project to compose dependencies from multiple disparate sources transparently.

This is configured via `vcpkg-configuration.json`Which sits alongside the manifest.

### The Registry Model

A vcpkg Registry is a Git repository containing:

1. **Ports:** Scripts (`portfile.cmake`) describing how to download and build a package.
2. **Versions:** A database mapping version numbers to Git tree objects.

### Configuring Federation

**File:** `vcpkg-configuration.json`

```json
{
  "default-registry": {
    "kind": "git",
    "repository": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg",
    "baseline": "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abc"
  },
  "registries": [
    {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/my-company/private-cpp-registry",
      "baseline": "f9e8d7c6b5a493827162639401827364a5b6c7d8",
      "packages": ["internal-logger", "proprietary-math"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Resolution Logic

1. Vcpkg parses the `packages` array of every defined registry.
2. If a dependency matches a package listed in a custom registry (e.g., `internal-logger`), vcpkg
   resolves it against that specific Git repository.
3. All other packages fall back to the `default-registry`.

This federation allows seamless mixing of public open-source libraries and private proprietary
Components within a single build graph.

## 3. CMake Integration

Vcpkg integrates into the build system via a **CMake Toolchain File**. This file intercepts
`find_package()` calls and redirects them to the vcpkg-installed artifacts.

### Bootstrapping vcpkg

To ensure reproducibility, vcpkg itself should be bootstrapped locally (often as a Git submodule)
Rather than relying on a global installation.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git external/vcpkg
./external/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # (or .bat on Windows)
```

### Configuring CMake

The integration occurs at the configuration step. You must define `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`.

**Command Line:**

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=external/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

**CMake Presets (Recommended):**

In `CMakePresets.json`Set the cache variable and the environment variable to toggle Manifest Mode.

```json
{
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "vcpkg-base",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "${sourceDir}/external/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake",
        "VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET": "x64-linux"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Linking Dependencies

Once configured, usage in `CMakeLists.txt` follows standard CMake patterns. Vcpkg ensures the
Libraries are available on the search path.

```cmake
find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(App PRIVATE fmt::fmt)
```

### How vcpkg Intercepts `find_package`

The vcpkg toolchain file modifies CMake's module search path (`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`) to include the
`vcpkg_installed/` directory. When `find_package(fmt)` is called, CMake searches for
`vcpkg_installed/x64-linux/share/fmt/fmtConfig.cmake` (or the Find module). If found, the package is
Available. If not found, CMake falls back to system-wide installations.

This mechanism is transparent to the project — standard CMake `find_package` calls work without
Modification.

## 4. Architectural Advantages

### 4.1 ODR Safety via Global Graph

Unlike package managers that allow nested dependencies (Node.js), vcpkg enforces a flat dependency
Graph. If `Lib A` needs `fmt 9.0` and `Lib B` needs `fmt 10.0`Vcpkg calculates a single version
(10.0) for the entire graph and recompiles `Lib A` against it. This prevents **One Definition Rule
(ODR)** violations and runtime ABI crashes.

### 4.2 Triplet-Based ABI Control

Vcpkg uses **Triplets** (e.g., `x64-windows-static``arm64-linux`) to define the build Configuration
for all dependencies. This allows an architect to switch the entire dependency tree From Dynamic
Linking to Static Linking, or change the CRT linkage, by modifying a single variable
(`VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET`).

### 4.3 Source-Based Provenance

Because vcpkg builds from source (unless Binary Caching is active), the resulting binaries are
Guaranteed to use the exact compiler flags (`-O3``-fsanitize=address`) of the parent project,
Ensuring complete binary compatibility.

## 5. Manifest Mode vs. Classic Mode

### Classic Mode (Deprecated)

In classic mode, vcpkg operates as a global package manager. Packages are installed into a shared
Directory and selected via environment variables.

```bash
# Classic mode (legacy, not recommended)
vcpkg install fmt:x64-windows
vcpkg integrate install  # modifies system-wide CMake settings
```

**Problems with Classic Mode:**

- **Global state:** Multiple projects share the same vcpkg installation, leading to version
  conflicts.
- **Non-reproducible:** `vcpkg install fmt` installs the latest version, which changes over time.
- **No dependency graph isolation:** Each project's dependencies bleed into each other.

### Manifest Mode (Recommended)

Manifest mode (enabled by default since vcpkg 2022.11.12) ties dependencies to the project via
`vcpkg.json` in the project root. This is the only mode discussed in this document.

```bash
# Manifest mode (automatic when vcpkg.json exists)
vcpkg install  # reads vcpkg.json, installs to vcpkg_installed/
```

## 6. Triplets and Platform Targeting

A **triplet** is a string that defines the target platform, architecture, and linkage model. Vcpkg
Uses triplets to control how every dependency is built.

### Common Triplets

| Triplet              | OS              | Architecture | Linkage       | CRT     |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------- |
| `x64-windows`        | Windows         | x86_64       | Dynamic (DLL) | MD/MDd  |
| `x64-windows-static` | Windows         | x86_64       | Static (LIB)  | MT/MTd  |
| `x64-linux`          | Linux           | x86_64       | Dynamic (SO)  | default |
| `x64-linux-static`   | Linux           | x86_64       | Static (A)    | default |
| `arm64-windows`      | Windows         | ARM64        | Dynamic (DLL) | MD/MDd  |
| `arm64-linux`        | Linux           | ARM64        | Dynamic (SO)  | default |
| `x64-mingw-dynamic`  | Windows (MinGW) | x86_64       | Dynamic       | default |
| `wasm32-emscripten`  | WebAssembly     | wasm32       | Static        | N/A     |

### Setting the Target Triplet

```bash
# Via environment variable
export VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-linux-static

# Via CMake
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=external/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-linux-static
```

### Custom Triplets

For embedded or specialized targets, create a custom triplet file:

**File:** `triplets/my-custom-linux.cmake`

```cmake
set(VCPKG_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE arm64)
set(VCPKG_CRT_LINKAGE dynamic)
set(VCPKG_LIBRARY_LINKAGE static)
set(VCPKG_CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)

# Pass additional CMake variables to all port builds
set(VCPKG_CMAKE_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS
    -DENABLE_NEON=ON
    -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON
)
```

```bash
vcpkg install fmt:my-custom-linux
```

## 7. Common Workflows

### Adding a Dependency

Edit `vcpkg.json` and add the package name. Then reconfigure CMake:

```bash
# vcpkg.json already updated with "spdlog"
cmake --build build  # triggers vcpkg to download and build spdlog
```

Or use the CLI (modifies `vcpkg.json` automatically):

```bash
vcpkg add spdlog
```

### Installing All Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies from vcpkg.json
vcpkg install

# Install for a specific triplet
vcpkg install --triplet arm64-linux
```

### Removing a Dependency

```bash
vcpkg remove spdlog
```

Or manually remove the entry from `vcpkg.json` and reconfigure.

### Updating Dependencies

```bash
# Check what can be updated
vcpkg update

# Update all dependencies to their latest versions within the baseline
vcpkg upgrade

# Update and rebuild everything (aggressive, may break)
vcpkg upgrade --no-dry-run
```

### Searching for Packages

```bash
vcpkg search json
# Output:
# nlohmann-json        3.11.3     JSON for Modern C++
# json-c               0.17       JSON manipulation in C
# rapidjson             1.1.0     Fast JSON parser/generator
```

### Listing Installed Packages

```bash
vcpkg list
```

### Exporting Installed Packages

Export the set of installed packages and their versions for auditing or deployment:

```bash
vcpkg export --output=vcpkg-export fmt nlohmann-json
```

## 8. Overlay Ports

When a library is not available in the public vcpkg registry, or you need a custom fork, you can use
**overlay ports**. An overlay port is a local directory containing a portfile that takes priority
Over the registry.

### Overlay Structure

```text
Project/
├── vcpkg.json
├── vcpkg-overlays/
│   └── my-custom-lib/
│       ├── portfile.cmake
│       └── vcpkg.json
```

**vcpkg-overlays/my-custom-lib/portfile.cmake:**

```cmake
vcpkg_from_github(
    OUT_SOURCE_PATH SOURCE_PATH
    REPO mycompany/custom-lib
    REF v2.1.0
    SHA512 abc123...
)

vcpkg_cmake_configure(
    SOURCE_PATH "${SOURCE_PATH}"
    OPTIONS
        -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF
)

vcpkg_cmake_install()
vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup()
```

### Using the Overlay

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=external/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
  -DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=vcpkg-overlays
```

Vcpkg resolves `my-custom-lib` from the overlay directory first, falling back to the public registry
For all other packages.

### Overlay Precedence

Overlay ports take precedence over registry ports. If an overlay defines a port with the same name
As a registry port, the overlay version is used. This allows you to:

1. Fork a library and use the fork instead of the upstream version.
2. Apply patches to an existing port without modifying the vcpkg registry.
3. Prototype a port before contributing it upstream.

## 9. Binary Caching with NuGet

Vcpkg packages binary artifacts as NuGet packages for storage and distribution. This is the most
Common binary caching backend in enterprise environments.

### Enabling NuGet Binary Cache

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES="clear;nuget,https://artifactory.example.com/nuget/vcpkg-cache,readwrite"

# Windows
$env:VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES="clear;nuget,https://artifactory.example.com/nuget/vcpkg-cache,readwrite"
```

### How It Works

1. After building a package, vcpkg zips the artifacts (`include/``lib/``bin/`).
2. It packages the zip as a NuGet package with the ABI hash as the version.
3. It pushes the package to the configured NuGet feed.
4. On subsequent builds, vcpkg queries the feed for a matching ABI hash before compiling.

### ABI Hash Computation

The ABI hash includes:

- Package name and version
- Target triplet
- Compiler version and flags
- Features enabled
- All transitive dependency versions and hashes

This ensures that a cached binary is only used when the exact same build configuration is in effect.

### Local Filesystem Cache (Quick Start)

For a single developer machine, a local filesystem cache avoids redundant rebuilds across projects:

```bash
export VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES="clear;files,$HOME/.cache/vcpkg,readwrite"
```

## 10. Portfile Structure

Every vcpkg port is defined by a `portfile.cmake` that describes how to download, build, and install
The package:

```cmake
# portfile.cmake structure (simplified)

# 1. Download the source
vcpkg_from_github(
    OUT_SOURCE_PATH SOURCE_PATH
    REPO fmtlib/fmt
    REF 10.1.1
    SHA512 <sha512-hash-of-archive>
    HEAD_REF master
)

# 2. Configure with CMake
vcpkg_cmake_configure(
    SOURCE_PATH "${SOURCE_PATH}"
    OPTIONS
        -DFMT_DOC=OFF
        -DFMT_TEST=OFF
)

# 3. Build and install
vcpkg_cmake_install()

# 4. Fix up CMake config files for find_package compatibility
vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup(CONFIG_PATH lib/cmake/fmt)

# 5. Copy usage documentation
vcpkg_install_copyright(FILE_LIST "${SOURCE_PATH}/LICENSE")
```

### Portfile Commands

| Command                    | Purpose                                         |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `vcpkg_from_github`        | Download source from GitHub                     |
| `vcpkg_from_gitlab`        | Download source from GitLab                     |
| `vcpkg_from_sourceforge`   | Download source from SourceForge                |
| `vcpkg_download_distfile`  | Download an arbitrary file (by URL)             |
| `vcpkg_cmake_configure`    | Run CMake configure step                        |
| `vcpkg_cmake_build`        | Run CMake build step                            |
| `vcpkg_cmake_install`      | Run CMake install step                          |
| `vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup` | Fix CMake config files for correct installation |
| `vcpkg_install_copyright`  | Install license/copyright files                 |

## 11. Private Registries

Organizations with proprietary libraries can host private vcpkg registries. A registry is a Git
Repository containing port definitions and version metadata.

### Registry Structure

```text
private-registry/
├── ports/
│   ├── internal-logger/
│   │   ├── portfile.cmake
│   │   └── vcpkg.json
│   └── proprietary-math/
│       ├── portfile.cmake
│       └── vcpkg.json
└── versions/
    └── internal-logger/
        └── baseline.json
```

### Configuring a Private Registry

In `vcpkg-configuration.json`:

```json
{
  "default-registry": {
    "kind": "git",
    "repository": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg",
    "baseline": "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abc"
  },
  "registries": [
    {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/mycompany/private-cpp-registry",
      "baseline": "f9e8d7c6b5a493827162639401827364a5b6c7d8",
      "packages": ["internal-logger", "proprietary-math"]
    }
  ]
}
```

When vcpkg encounters `internal-logger` in the dependency list, it fetches the port definition from
The private registry instead of the public Microsoft registry.

## 12. CI Integration with vcpkg

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive

      - name: Bootstrap vcpkg
        run: ./external/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

      - name: Configure
        run: |
          cmake -S . -B build \
            -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=external/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
            -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-linux

      - name: Build
        run: cmake --build build
```

### Caching vcpkg Installed Packages

Since vcpkg builds from source by default, CI builds can be slow. Enable binary caching to avoid
Rebuilding dependencies on every CI run:

```yaml
- name: Restore vcpkg packages
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      vcpkg_installed
      ~/.cache/vcpkg
    key: vcpkg-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('vcpkg.json') }}
```

### Self-Hosted CI with Pre-Built Cache

For self-hosted runners, maintain a persistent `vcpkg_installed/` directory. Dependencies are only
Rebuilt when `vcpkg.json` changes:

```bash
# On the CI runner, set a persistent vcpkg root
export VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-linux
export VCPKG_ROOT=/opt/vcpkg
```

## 13. Vcpkg vs Conan Comparison

| Feature                  | vcpkg                                | Conan                                   |

| Community packages       | ~2000+                               | ~1800+                                  |

### When to Choose vcpkg

- Your project uses CMake exclusively.
- You need ODR-safe flat dependency resolution.
- You want tight integration with Microsoft tooling (Visual Studio, Azure CI).
- You prefer JSON manifests over Python scripts.

### When to Choose Conan

- Your project uses multiple build systems (CMake, Meson, Bazel).
- You need complex cross-compilation with multiple profiles.
- You want a Python-based portfile API for maximum flexibility.
- You already use JFrog Artifactory in your organization.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Mixing triplets in the same build tree:** If you change `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET` without clearing
   the build directory, stale artifacts from the previous triplet may cause linker errors. Always
   delete `build/` and `vcpkg_installed/` when changing triplets.
2. **Forgetting `--triplet` for CLI commands:** `vcpkg install fmt` installs the default triplet,
   which may not match your project's triplet. Always specify: `vcpkg install fmt:x64-linux-static`.
3. **Overlay port SHA512 mismatch:** When using overlays, the `SHA512` in `portfile.cmake` must
   match the downloaded archive. If you update the archive without updating the hash, vcpkg will
   fail with a checksum error.
4. **NuGet mono dependency on Linux/macOS:** vcpkg's NuGet binary cache requires `mono` on
   non-Windows platforms. Install it via `brew install mono` or `apt install mono-complete`.
5. **Not pinning the vcpkg submodule commit:** If you use vcpkg as a submodule, the submodule commit
   determines which baseline is used. Different developers with different submodule commits will
   build different dependency versions. Pin the submodule to a specific commit.
6. **Stale `vcpkg_installed/` after `vcpkg.json` changes:** When you modify `vcpkg.json` (add or
   remove a dependency), the `vcpkg_installed/` directory may contain stale artifacts. Delete it and
   reconfigure: `rm -rf vcpkg_installed && cmake --fresh -S . -B build`.
7. **`find_package` failing after vcpkg install:** Ensure the toolchain file is passed to every
   CMake invocation. If you configure without the toolchain file, `find_package` will not search the
   vcpkg installation directory.
8. **Host vs target confusion with cross-compilation:** When cross-compiling (e.g., x64 host
   building for ARM64 target), build tools (protoc, flatbuffers compiler) must be built for the host
   architecture. Use `"host": true` on these dependencies to ensure correct resolution.
