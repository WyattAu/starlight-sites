# Inheritance, Object Slicing, and Virtual Destructors

Inheritance allows derived classes to extend base classes, but copying polymorphic objects by value
Causes **object slicing** -- the derived portion is discarded. This section covers single and
Multiple inheritance, object slicing, virtual destructors, pure virtual functions, and interface
Conventions.

## 2.1 Single and Multiple Inheritance

A derived class inherits from one or more base classes [N4950 S11.7]. Each base class subobject is
Laid out in memory according to the inheritance graph.

**Single inheritance:** The derived class extends the base by appending its own members after the
Base subobject. Only one vptr is needed (shared with the base).

**Multiple inheritance:** Each base class subobject retains its own vptr (if polymorphic). The
Derived object contains multiple base subobjects, each at a distinct offset.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct A {
    virtual void fa() { std::cout << "A::fa\n"; }
    int a_val{};
    virtual ~A() = default;
};

struct B {
    virtual void fb() { std::cout << "B::fb\n"; }
    int b_val{};
    virtual ~B() = default;
};

struct C : A, B {
    void fa() override { std::cout << "C::fa\n"; }
    void fb() override { std::cout << "C::fb\n"; }
    int c_val{};
};

int main() {
    C c;
    c.fa();
    c.fb();

    A* pa = &c;
    B* pb = &c;

    std::cout << "pa = " << pa << "\n";
    std::cout << "pb = " << pb << "\n";
    std::cout << "&c = " << static_cast<void*>(&c) << "\n";

    pa->fa();
    pb->fb();
}
```

:::note With multiple inheritance, `pa` and `pb` point to **different addresses** within the same
`C` object -- they point to the respective base subobjects. The compiler generates **thunks** (small
Adjustment stubs) to correct the `this` pointer when dispatching virtual calls through non-primary
Bases.
:::

## 2.2 Object Slicing

Object slicing occurs when a derived object is copied into a base-class object by value. Only the
Base-class subobject is copied; the derived portion is discarded [N4950 S11.4.5.3].

### Formal Definition [N4950 S11.4.5.3]

When an object of class type is copied, the copy operation is defined by the copy constructor or
Copy assignment operator of the **static type** of the destination. If the static type is a base
Class and the source object is of a derived type, only the base class subobject is copied. The
Derived-class members are not copied, and the vptr is set to the base class"s vtable.

### Proof That Slicing Loses the Dynamic Type

Let `B` be a base class with virtual function `f`And `D` be a derived class that overrides `f`. Let
`d` be an object of type `D`. Consider the copy `B b = d;`.

1. The copy constructor of `B` is called (the static type of `b` is `B`).
2. `B`'s copy constructor copies only the `B` subobject of `d` -- it has no knowledge of `D`'s
   members [N4950 S11.4.5.3].
3. The vptr of `b` is initialized to `B::vtable` (not `D::vtable`), because `b` is an object of type
   `B`.
4. Therefore, `b.f()` dispatches through `B::vtable` and calls `B::f`Not `D::f`.

This proves that object slicing discards both the derived data members and the overridden virtual
Function dispatch. The dynamic type of `b` is `B`Regardless of the dynamic type of `d`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Animal {
    std::string name;
    virtual std::string speak() const { return "..."; }
    virtual ~Animal() = default;
};

struct Dog : Animal {
    std::string breed;
    std::string speak() const override { return "Woof!"; }
};

void process_by_value(Animal a) {
    std::cout << "process_by_value: " << a.speak() << "\n";
}

void process_by_ref(const Animal& a) {
    std::cout << "process_by_ref:   " << a.speak() << "\n";
}

void process_by_ptr(const Animal* a) {
    std::cout << "process_by_ptr:   " << a->speak() << "\n";
}

int main() {
    Dog d{"Rex", "Labrador"};
    std::cout << "Direct:           " << d.speak() << "\n";

    process_by_value(d);
    process_by_ref(d);
    process_by_ptr(&d);

    Animal sliced = d;
    std::cout << "Sliced:           " << sliced.speak() << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
Direct:           Woof!
process_by_value: ...
process_by_ref:   Woof!
process_by_ptr:   Woof!
Sliced:           ...
```

When `d` is passed by value to `process_by_value`Only the `Animal` subobject is copied. The vptr Is
set to `Animal`'s vtable, so `a.speak()` dispatches to `Animal::speak`. The `Dog`-specific data
(`breed`) and the `Dog::speak` override are lost.

:::caution Never pass polymorphic objects by value. Always use pointers (`Animal*`) or references
(`Animal&` / `const Animal&`) to preserve the dynamic type.
:::

## 2.3 Slicing in Containers

One of the most common sources of slicing is storing polymorphic objects in `std::vector` by value.
Since `std::vector<T>` stores `T` objects directly, pushing a `Derived` object into a
`std::vector<Base>` slices it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Shape {
    std::string name_;
    explicit Shape(std::string name) : name_(std::move(name)) {}
    virtual double area() const = 0;
    virtual ~Shape() = default;
};

struct Circle : Shape {
    double radius_;
    explicit Circle(double r) : Shape("Circle"), radius_(r) {}
    double area() const override { return 3.14159265 * radius_ * radius_; }
};

struct Rectangle : Shape {
    double width_, height_;
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : Shape("Rectangle"), width_(w), height_(h) {}
    double area() const override { return width_ * height_; }
};

void demonstrate_slicing() {
    std::vector<Shape> shapes;  // WRONG: stores Shape by value
    shapes.push_back(Circle(3.0));     // SLICED: becomes Shape
    shapes.push_back(Rectangle(4, 5)); // SLICED: becomes Shape

    for (const auto& s : shapes) {
        std::cout << s.name_ << ": area=" << s.area() << "\n";
    }
    // Both calls dispatch to Shape::area (pure virtual -- UB!)
    // Or if Shape::area had a body, it would be called instead of the overrides.
}

void demonstrate_correct() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Shape>> shapes;  // CORRECT: stores pointers
    shapes.push_back(std::make_unique<Circle>(3.0));
    shapes.push_back(std::make_unique<Rectangle>(4, 5));

    for (const auto& s : shapes) {
        std::cout << s->name_ << ": area=" << s->area() << "\n";
    }
    // Correctly dispatches to Circle::area and Rectangle::area
}

int main() {
    demonstrate_correct();
}
```

Output from `demonstrate_correct()`:

```
Circle: area=28.2743
Rectangle: area=20
```

## 2.4 Virtual Destructors

If a derived object is deleted through a base-class pointer and the base class's destructor is
**not** `virtual`The behavior is undefined [N4950 S11.4.7]:

### Proof: Why Virtual Destructors Are Necessary [N4950 S11.4.7]

When `delete` is called on a pointer to class type `B`The destructor selected is determined by the
_static type_ of the pointer if `B`'s destructor is non-virtual. If `B`'s destructor is virtual, the
Destructor selected is determined by the _dynamic type_ of the object.

1. If `Base::~Base()` is non-virtual and `delete base_ptr` is called where `base_ptr` actually
   points to a `Derived` object, the static type is `Base*`. The compiler generates a direct call to
   `Base::~Base()`.
2. `Derived::~Derived()` never runs. Resources held by `Derived` (file handles, heap memory, network
   connections) are leaked.
3. By [N4950 S11.4.7], if the static type of the operand of `delete` is different from its dynamic
   type and the static type's destructor is not virtual, the behavior is undefined.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct BadBase {
    ~BadBase() { std::cout << "BadBase dtor\n"; }
};

struct BadDerived : BadBase {
    ~BadDerived() { std::cout << "BadDerived dtor\n"; }
};

struct GoodBase {
    virtual ~GoodBase() { std::cout << "GoodBase dtor\n"; }
};

struct GoodDerived : GoodBase {
    ~GoodDerived() { std::cout << "GoodDerived dtor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "--- Bad (UB) ---\n";
    BadBase* bp = new BadDerived{};
    delete bp;

    std::cout << "--- Good ---\n";
    GoodBase* gp = new GoodDerived{};
    delete gp;
}
```

Output:

```
--- Bad (UB) ---
BadBase dtor
--- Good ---
GoodDerived dtor
GoodBase dtor
```

With `BadBase`Only `BadBase::~BadBase()` is called -- `BadDerived::~BadDerived()` never runs,
Causing resource leaks. With `GoodBase`The virtual dispatch mechanism selects
`GoodDerived::~GoodDerived()`Which then implicitly calls `GoodBase::~GoodBase()`.

:::tip Rule If a class has **any** virtual function, its destructor **must** also be virtual. If a
Class is designed to be a polymorphic base class, always declare `virtual ~Base() = default;` (or
Provide a virtual destructor with a body).
:::

### Destructor Chaining Order

When a `Derived` object is destroyed through a `Base*` with a virtual destructor:

1. `Derived::~Derived()` runs (body, then member destruction).
2. `Base::~Base()` runs (body, then member destruction).
3. The deallocation function (`operator delete`) is called with the size and alignment of the
   _most-derived_ type (the Itanium ABI stores the size in the vtable for this purpose).

This ordering is guaranteed by [N4950 S11.9.3]: destructors are called in the reverse order of
Construction.

## 2.5 Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

A **pure virtual function** is declared using the `= 0` syntax [N4950 S13.4.4]. A class with at
Least one pure virtual function is an **abstract class** -- it cannot be instantiated directly.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <cmath>

struct Shape {
    virtual double area() const = 0;
    virtual double perimeter() const = 0;
    virtual void describe() const = 0;
    virtual ~Shape() = default;
};

struct Circle : Shape {
    double radius;

    explicit Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    double area() const override {
        return M_PI * radius * radius;
    }

    double perimeter() const override {
        return 2 * M_PI * radius;
    }

    void describe() const override {
        std::cout << "Circle(r=" << radius << ")\n";
    }
};

struct Rectangle : Shape {
    double width;
    double height;

    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {}

    double area() const override {
        return width * height;
    }

    double perimeter() const override {
        return 2 * (width + height);
    }

    void describe() const override {
        std::cout << "Rectangle(" << width << "x" << height << ")\n";
    }
};

void print_all(const std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Shape>>& shapes) {
    double total = 0;
    for (const auto& s : shapes) {
        s->describe();
        std::cout << "  area = " << s->area() << "\n";
        std::cout << "  perimeter = " << s->perimeter() << "\n";
        total += s->area();
    }
    std::cout << "Total area: " << total << "\n";
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Shape>> shapes;
    shapes.push_back(std::make_unique<Circle>(3.0));
    shapes.push_back(std::make_unique<Rectangle>(4.0, 5.0));
    shapes.push_back(std::make_unique<Circle>(1.5));

    print_all(shapes);
}
```

Key properties of pure virtual functions:

- A pure virtual function **may** have a definition in the base class. The class is still abstract,
  but derived classes can explicitly call it via `Base::f()`.
- A derived class that does not provide an override for all inherited pure virtual functions is
  itself abstract.
- Abstract classes can have data members and non-pure virtual functions.

## 2.6 Interfaces in C++

C++ does not have a native `interface` keyword (unlike Java or C#). An **interface** in C++ is a
Convention: a class with only pure virtual functions and no data members.

```cpp
#include <string>

struct ISerializable {
    virtual ~ISerializable() = default;
    virtual std::string serialize() const = 0;
    virtual void deserialize(const std::string& data) = 0;
};

struct IRenderable {
    virtual ~IRenderable() = default;
    virtual void render() const = 0;
    virtual void update(double dt) = 0;
};

class Player : public ISerializable, public IRenderable {
public:
    std::string serialize() const override {
        return "Player{name=" + name_ + ",x=" + std::to_string(x_)
             + ",y=" + std::to_string(y_) + "}";
    }

    void deserialize(const std::string& data) override {
        (void)data;
    }

    void render() const override { }
    void update(double dt) override { (void)dt; }

private:
    std::string name_{"Hero"};
    double x_{0.0};
    double y_{0.0};
};
```

:::note Convention Prefixing interface names with `I` (e.g., `ISerializable`) is a common C++
Convention borrowed from COM and C#. It is not mandated by the Standard. Alternatives include
Suffixes like `-able` (e.g., `Serializable`).
:::

## 2.7 Virtual Inheritance and the Diamond Problem

When two base classes each inherit from the same base, a **diamond inheritance** pattern arises.
Without **virtual inheritance**, the derived object contains **two separate copies** of the common
Base subobject, leading to ambiguity [N4950 S11.7.1]:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Device {
    int id{};
    void init() { std::cout << "Device::init id=" << id << "\n"; }
};

struct Printer : Device {
    void print() { std::cout << "printing\n"; }
};

struct Scanner : Device {
    void scan() { std::cout << "scanning\n"; }
};

// WITHOUT virtual inheritance: two Device subobjects
struct PrintScanner_Bad : Printer, Scanner {
};

// WITH virtual inheritance: ONE shared Device subobject
struct Printer_V : virtual Device {
    void print() { std::cout << "printing\n"; }
};

struct Scanner_V : virtual Device {
    void scan() { std::cout << "scanning\n"; }
};

struct PrintScanner_Good : Printer_V, Scanner_V {
};

int main() {
    PrintScanner_Bad ps_bad;
    // ps_bad.id = 42;  // ERROR: ambiguous -- which Device::id?
    ps_bad.Printer::id = 1;
    ps_bad.Scanner::id = 2;
    std::cout << "Printer::id=" << ps_bad.Printer::id
              << " Scanner::id=" << ps_bad.Scanner::id << "\n";

    PrintScanner_Good ps_good;
    ps_good.id = 42;  // OK: single shared Device subobject
    ps_good.init();
    ps_good.print();
    ps_good.scan();
}
```

Output:

```
Printer::id=1 Scanner::id=2
Device::init id=42
printing
scanning
```

With virtual inheritance, `Device` becomes a **virtual base**, and the most-derived class
(`PrintScanner_Good`) is responsible for constructing it. The compiler generates a hidden vbase
Pointer (stored in the vtable or as a separate vptr) to locate the shared `Device` subobject at
Runtime. This adds one level of indirection to every access of a virtual base member [N4950
S11.7.1].

:::caution Virtual inheritance adds runtime cost: accessing members of a virtual base requires an
Extra indirection through the vbase offset table. Construction order is also affected -- virtual
Bases are constructed by the most-derived class, before any non-virtual base classes [N4950
S11.9.3]. Avoid virtual inheritance unless the diamond pattern is genuinely needed.
:::

## 2.8 `override``final`And Name Hiding

A derived class member function with the **same name** as a base class function **hides** all base
Class overloads with that name, regardless of signature [N4950 S11.8.3]. This is one of the most
Insidious bugs in C++ inheritance:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Base {
    virtual void process(int x) { std::cout << "Base::process(int): " << x << "\n"; }
    virtual void process(double x) { std::cout << "Base::process(double): " << x << "\n"; }
    virtual ~Base() = default;
};

struct Derived_Wrong : Base {
    // This HIDES both Base::process overloads -- does NOT override either
    void process(int x) { std::cout << "Derived::process(int): " << x << "\n"; }
};

struct Derived_Right : Base {
    // 'override' verifies this matches a base class virtual function
    void process(int x) override { std::cout << "Derived_Right::process(int): " << x << "\n"; }

    // Bring remaining base overloads into scope
    using Base::process;
};

int main() {
    Derived_Wrong dw;
    dw.process(1);      // OK: calls Derived_Wrong::process(int)
    // dw.process(1.5);  // ERROR: Base::process(double) is hidden!

    Derived_Right dr;
    dr.process(1);      // Calls Derived_Right::process(int)
    dr.process(1.5);    // OK: "using Base::process'' makes it visible
}
```

The `using Base::process;` declaration in `Derived_Right` un-hides the remaining overloads from
`Base`. Without it, only the derived-class version is visible in overload resolution. This hiding
Applies even when the derived function is `virtual` and does override one specific overload -- all
Other overloads are still hidden.

:::tip Best Practice When overriding a base class function that participates in overloading, always
Add `using Base::function_name;` in the derived class to avoid accidentally hiding sibling
Overloads. The `override` keyword catches signature mismatches but does not prevent hiding.
:::

## 2.9 Slicing and Return Values

Object slicing also occurs when returning by value. A function that returns `Base` will slice any
`Derived` object stored in the return value:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Base {
    virtual void identify() const { std::cout << "Base\n"; }
    virtual ~Base() = default;
};

struct Derived : Base {
    void identify() const override { std::cout << "Derived\n"; }
};

Base make_derived() {
    return Derived{};  // Slicing: returns Base subobject
}

const Base& make_ref() {
    static Derived d;
    return d;  // OK: no slicing
}

int main() {
    Base b = make_derived();
    b.identify();  // Prints "Base" -- was sliced

    const Base& r = make_ref();
    r.identify();  // Prints "Derived" -- no slicing
}
```

## 2.10 Slicing and Assignment Operators

Object slicing also occurs through assignment. When you assign a `Derived` object to a `Base`
Variable, the assignment operator of `Base` is invoked, copying only the base subobject:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Vehicle {
    std::string make;
    int year;
    virtual std::string info() const { return make + " (" + std::to_string(year) + ")"; }
    virtual ~Vehicle() = default;
};

struct Car : Vehicle {
    int doors;
    Car(std::string m, int y, int d) : Vehicle{std::move(m), y}, doors(d) {}
    std::string info() const override {
        return Vehicle::info() + " [" + std::to_string(doors) + " doors]";
    }
};

int main() {
    Car c{"Toyota", 2024, 4};
    std::cout << "Original: " << c.info() << "\n";

    Vehicle v;
    v = c;  // Assignment slicing: copies Vehicle subobject only
    std::cout << "After assignment: " << v.info() << "\n";
    // Output: Toyota (2024) -- doors information lost
}
```

Note the difference between copy-initialization (`Vehicle v = c;`) and assignment (`v = c;`). Both
Invoke the base-class copy mechanism, but the first uses the copy constructor and the second uses
The copy assignment operator. Both slice.

## 2.11 Slicing and Exception Objects

When a derived exception type is caught by value as a base exception type, the exception is sliced.
This is one of the reasons why exceptions should always be caught by reference:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

class AppError : public std::runtime_error {
public:
    int error_code;
    explicit AppError(const std::string& msg, int code)
        : std::runtime_error(msg), error_code(code) {}

    const char* full_info() const noexcept {
        return (std::string(what()) + " [code=" + std::to_string(error_code) + "]").c_str();
    }
};

void risky_operation() {
    throw AppError("database connection failed", 42);
}

int main() {
    try {
        risky_operation();
    } catch (std::runtime_error e) {  // SLICED: caught by value
        std::cout << "Caught (sliced): " << e.what() << "\n";
        // error_code is lost -- cannot access AppError-specific members
    }

    try {
        risky_operation();
    } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {  // NOT sliced: caught by reference
        std::cout << "Caught (reference): " << e.what() << "\n";
        if (auto* ae = dynamic_cast<const AppError*>(&e)) {
            std::cout << "Error code: " << ae->error_code << "\n";
        }
    }
}
```

:::caution Always catch exceptions by reference (`const std::exception& e`). Catching by value
Slices the exception object, losing derived-class information and potentially invoking slicing in
The exception handler itself.

## 2.12 Preventing Slicing at Compile Time

While C++ does not provide a built-in mechanism to prevent slicing, you can use several techniques
To detect or prevent it:

### Technique 1: Deleted Copy Operations for Base Classes

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <utility>

struct NonCopyableBase {
    NonCopyableBase() = default;
    NonCopyableBase(const NonCopyableBase&) = delete;
    NonCopyableBase& operator=(const NonCopyableBase&) = delete;
    NonCopyableBase(NonCopyableBase&&) = default;
    NonCopyableBase& operator=(NonCopyableBase&&) = default;
    virtual ~NonCopyableBase() = default;
};

struct Derived : NonCopyableBase {
    int data{};
};

// NonCopyableBase b = Derived{};  // ERROR: copy constructor deleted
```

This approach prevents slicing through copy-initialization and copy-assignment but still allows move
Semantics and polymorphic use through pointers and references.

### Technique 2: Clang-Tidy Slicing Check

Clang-Tidy provides the `cppcoreguidelines-slicing` check that detects object slicing:

```bash
clang-tidy --checks="cppcoreguidelines-slicing' file.cpp
```

This is a static analysis tool and does not add runtime overhead.

## Common Pitfalls

**1. Slicing through container value semantics:** `std::vector&lt;Base>` stores `Base` objects.
Pushing a `Derived` object slices it. Use `std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Base>>` or
`std::vector&lt;Base*>` to store polymorphic objects.

**2. Copying polymorphic objects:** The compiler-generated copy constructor performs a memberwise
Copy of the static type. To correctly copy a polymorphic object through a base pointer, you need a
**virtual `clone()` method** (the Prototype pattern):

```cpp
struct Cloneable {
    virtual ~Cloneable() = default;
    virtual std::unique_ptr<Cloneable> clone() const = 0;

**3. Deleting through a non-virtual destructor:** This is undefined behavior per [N4950 S11.4.7].
The base destructor does not run, leaking resources. Always declare `virtual ~Base() = default;` on
Any class intended as a polymorphic base.

**4. Slicing in function parameters:** When a function takes a base class by value, any derived
Object passed to it is sliced. This includes implicit conversions: if a function takes `std::string`
By value and you pass a subclass of `std::string`The derived part is lost.

**5. Assuming `sizeof(Derived) == sizeof(Base) + sizeof(Derived-Only-Members)`:** Alignment padding,
Additional vptrs (from multiple inheritance), and virtual base pointers all add to
`sizeof(Derived)`. Never assume a simple additive relationship.

## Summary

This topic covers the core concepts of inheritance, object slicing, and virtual destructors,
including underlying theory, practical implementation, and key applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- core concepts and terminology
- algorithms and computational thinking
- practical implementation
- security and ethical considerations
- applications in the real world

Understanding these concepts thoroughly is essential for both examinations and practical
programming, and requires both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice.
