## Condition Variables, Latches, and Barriers

This section covers `std::condition_variable` and `std::condition_variable_any`Spurious wakeups,
Producer-consumer patterns, and the C++20 synchronization primitives `std::latch` and `std::barrier`
For one-shot and reusable phase synchronization.

## `std::condition_variable`

`std::condition_variable` [N4950 §31.5.4] provides a mechanism for threads to wait until a shared
Condition is met. It always works with a `std::unique_lock<std::mutex>`.

Key operations:

| Operation          | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wait(lock)`       | Releases the lock, blocks the thread, re-acquires the lock on wakeup |
| `wait(lock, pred)` | Equivalent to `while (!pred()) wait(lock);`                          |
| `notify_one()`     | Wakes one waiting thread                                             |
| `notify_all()`     | Wakes all waiting threads                                            |

### How `wait()` Works Internally

When a thread calls `wait(lock)`The following sequence occurs:

1. The thread atomically releases the mutex and blocks.
2. When notified (or spuriously woken), the thread re-acquires the mutex before returning.
3. The atomicity of "release mutex + block" is critical. Without it, a notification sent between
   the mutex release and the block would be lost.

On Linux, `std::condition_variable` is implemented using `pthread_cond_t`Which uses the Futex system
call. The mutex is released atomically with the futex wait via `pthread_cond_wait` Which internally
calls `futex_wait` with the mutex address as part of the wait queue.

## Spurious Wakeups and the Predicate Loop

A **spurious wakeup** is an unwarranted wakeup where `wait()` returns even though no `notify_one()`
Or `notify_all()` was called. The C++ standard explicitly permits this [N4950 §31.5.4.1]:

> "Calls to functions that unblock the execution of any of the threads blocked on a condition
> variable may unblock zero or more threads that are blocked on that condition variable."

Because of spurious wakeups, the predicate-overloaded version of `wait()` must always be used:

```cpp
// WRONG: vulnerable to spurious wakeups
cv.wait(lock);

// CORRECT: predicate version handles spurious wakeups
cv.wait(lock, [this] { return !queue_.empty(); });
```

The predicate version is equivalent to [N4950 §31.5.4.1]:

```cpp
while (!pred()) {
    wait(lock);
}
```

### Why Spurious Wakeups Exist

Spurious wakeups are not a bug — they are a deliberate design choice mandated by hardware and OS
Constraints:

1. **POSIX allows them**: The POSIX specification for `pthread_cond_wait` explicitly permits
   spurious wakeups, and C++ condition variables are built on top of POSIX primitives.
2. **Performance**: On some architectures, it is cheaper to occasionally spuriously wake a thread
   than to guarantee exact wakeup semantics. The futex system call on Linux may spuriously return
   `EINTR` if a signal is delivered to the waiting thread.
3. **Implementations**: On some platforms, condition variables are implemented using shared memory
   and atomic operations, where distinguishing between a genuine notification and a coincidental
   state change is impractical.

### Lost Wakeup Problem

If `notify_one()` is called before `wait()` begins waiting, the notification is lost and the waiting
Thread may block forever. The mutex prevents this: the notifying thread must hold the mutex while
Modifying the shared state and calling `notify_one()`. The waiting thread checks the predicate while
Holding the mutex. If the predicate is already true, it never calls `wait()`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <thread>

std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool ready = false;

void notifier() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mtx);
    ready = true;
    cv.notify_one();  // If waiter hasn"t reached wait() yet...
}

void waiter() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(mtx);
    // ...the predicate is already true, so wait() returns immediately
    cv.wait(lk, [] { return ready; });
    std::cout << "Ready!\n";
}

int main() {
    std::jthread t1(notifier);
    std::jthread t2(waiter);
    return 0;
}
```

## `std::condition_variable_any`

`std::condition_variable_any` [N4950 §31.5.5] is similar to `std::condition_variable` but can work
With any **Lockable** type (not just `std::unique_lock<std::mutex>`). It may be less efficient than
`std::condition_variable` because it cannot use platform-specific optimizations that rely on
`std::mutex`.

### When to Use `condition_variable_any`

Use `condition_variable_any` when you need to use a non-standard lock type, such as a
`std::shared_mutex` for read-write locking:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <shared_mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <queue>
#include <thread>
#include <string>

class SharedState {
    mutable std::shared_mutex rw_mtx_;
    std::condition_variable_any cv_;
    std::queue<std::string> queue_;

public:
    void push(std::string msg) {
        std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lk(rw_mtx_);
        queue_.push(std::move(msg));
        cv_.notify_one();
    }

    std::string pop() {
        std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lk(rw_mtx_);
        cv_.wait(lk, [this] { return !queue_.empty(); });
        auto msg = std::move(queue_.front());
        queue_.pop();
        return msg;
    }

    bool empty() const {
        std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lk(rw_mtx_);
        return queue_.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    SharedState state;
    std::jthread producer([&state] {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
            state.push("message " + std::to_string(i));
        }
    });
    std::jthread consumer([&state](std::stop_token st) {
        int count = 0;
        while (count < 5 && !st.stop_requested()) {
            auto msg = state.pop();
            std::cout << "Got: " << msg << "\n";
            ++count;
        }
    });
    return 0;
}
```

## `wait_for` and `wait_until`: Timed Waits

Condition variables support timed waiting, which is essential for implementing timeouts and
Polling-based patterns:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <chrono>

std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool data_ready = false;

int main() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(mtx);

    if (cv.wait_for(lk, std::chrono::seconds(2), [] { return data_ready; })) {
        std::cout << "Data ready within timeout\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Timeout expired\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
// Output: Timeout expired
```

The predicate version of `wait_for` returns `true` if the predicate became `true` before the
Timeout, and `false` if the timeout expired (regardless of whether the predicate is true at that
Point). Without the predicate, `wait_for` returns `cv_status::no_timeout` if notified or
`cv_status::timeout` if the timeout expired — spurious wakeups return `no_timeout`Which is another
Reason to always use the predicate version.

## Producer-Consumer with Condition Variable

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>

template <typename T>
class thread_safe_queue {
    std::queue<T> queue_;
    std::mutex mutex_;
    std::condition_variable cv_not_empty_;
    std::condition_variable cv_not_full_;
    size_t max_size_;

public:
    explicit thread_safe_queue(size_t max_size = 100)
        : max_size_(max_size) {}

    void push(T value) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
        cv_not_full_.wait(lock, [this] {
            return queue_.size() < max_size_;
        });
        queue_.push(std::move(value));
        lock.unlock();
        cv_not_empty_.notify_one();
    }

    T pop() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
        cv_not_empty_.wait(lock, [this] {
            return !queue_.empty();
        });
        T value = std::move(queue_.front());
        queue_.pop();
        lock.unlock();
        cv_not_full_.notify_one();
        return value;
    }

    bool try_pop(T& value, std::chrono::milliseconds timeout) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
        if (!cv_not_empty_.wait_for(lock, timeout, [this] {
            return !queue_.empty();
        })) {
            return false;
        }
        value = std::move(queue_.front());
        queue_.pop();
        lock.unlock();
        cv_not_full_.notify_one();
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    thread_safe_queue<int> q(10);

    std::jthread producer([&q] {
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
            q.push(i);
            std::cout << "Produced: " << i << "\n";
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50));
        }
    });

    std::jthread consumer([&q](std::stop_token stoken) {
        int count = 0;
        while (!stoken.stop_requested() || count < 20) {
            int value;
            if (q.try_pop(value, std::chrono::milliseconds(200))) {
                std::cout << "Consumed: " << value << "\n";
                ++count;
            }
        }
    });

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));
    return 0;
}
```

### Notify Outside the Lock: Why It Matters

In the producer-consumer example above, `notify_one()` is called after `lock.unlock()`. This is a
Deliberate optimization: if the notification is sent while the lock is held, the woken thread
Immediately tries to re-acquire the lock and blocks again, causing an unnecessary context switch. By
Notifying after unlocking, the woken thread can acquire the lock immediately.

This pattern is sometimes called "unlock-then-notify":

```cpp
// Pattern: unlock then notify
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mtx_);
    // modify shared state
}
cv_.notify_one();  // Notify after lock is released
```

## `std::latch` (C++20)

`std::latch` [N4950 §31.4.4.3] is a one-shot synchronization primitive. It is initialized with a
Count and threads decrement the count. When the count reaches zero, all threads waiting on the latch
Are unblocked.

| Operation            | Description                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `count_down(n)`      | Decrements the counter by `n`         |
| `wait()`             | Blocks until the counter reaches zero |
| `arrive_and_wait(n)` | Decrements by `n` and then waits      |
| `try_wait()`         | Returns `true` if the counter is zero |

A latch is useful for **one-time barriers** such as waiting for all worker threads to finish
Initialization before proceeding.

### Implementation Details

`std::latch` is implemented using an atomic counter and an internal condition variable or Futex. The
key invariant is that `count_down` is thread-safe and `wait` blocks until the counter Reaches zero.
Once zero, the latch is "done" and all subsequent `wait()` calls return immediately.

## `std::barrier` (C++20)

`std::barrier` [N4950 §31.4.4.5] is a reusable synchronization point. Unlike `std::latch`A barrier
Resets its counter after all threads arrive, allowing it to be reused across multiple phases.

| Operation           | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `arrive(arrival)`   | Decrements the expected count                         |
| `wait()`            | Blocks until all threads have arrived                 |
| `arrive_and_wait()` | Arrives and then waits                                |
| `arrive_and_drop()` | Arrives and permanently decrements the expected count |

The barrier can accept a **completion function** that is executed once when all threads arrive,
Before any waiting thread is released:

$$
\mathrm{Phase  k \to \mathrm{completion function \to \mathrm{Phase  k+1
$$

## Barrier Synchronization for Parallel Computation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <barrier>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <chrono>

int main() {
    constexpr int num_threads = 4;
    constexpr int num_phases = 5;

    std::vector<int> partial_sums(num_threads, 0);
    std::barrier sync_point(num_threads, [&partial_sums] noexcept {
        int total = std::accumulate(partial_sums.begin(), partial_sums.end(), 0);
        std::cout << "Phase total: " << total << "\n";
        std::fill(partial_sums.begin(), partial_sums.end(), 0);
    });

    auto worker = [&](int id, std::stop_token stoken) {
        for (int phase = 0; phase < num_phases && !stoken.stop_requested(); ++phase) {
            int work = (id + 1) * (phase + 1) * 10;
            partial_sums[id] = work;
            std::cout << "  Thread " << id << " phase " << phase
                      << " contributed " << work << "\n";
            sync_point.arrive_and_wait();
        }
    };

    std::vector<std::jthread> threads;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_threads; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(worker, i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Completion Function Execution

The completion function in `std::barrier` is executed **exactly once** per phase, by the **last
Thread to arrive** at the barrier. This is important: the completion function runs while other
Threads are still blocked. The completion function must not block (doing so would prevent other
Threads from being released), and it must not throw.

### `arrive_and_drop`: Dynamic Thread Count

`arrive_and_drop()` allows a thread to permanently reduce the expected thread count. This is useful
When worker threads finish early and the remaining threads should synchronize with a smaller group:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <barrier>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    auto on_phase_complete = [] noexcept {
        std::cout << "Phase complete\n";
    };

    std::barrier b(4, on_phase_complete);

    auto worker = [&](int id) {
        if (id < 2) {
            for (int phase = 0; phase < 3; ++phase) {
                std::cout << "Thread " << id << " phase " << phase << "\n";
                b.arrive_and_wait();
            }
            b.arrive_and_drop();  // Permanently remove this thread from the barrier
        } else {
            for (int phase = 0; phase < 2; ++phase) {
                std::cout << "Thread " << id << " phase " << phase << "\n";
                b.arrive_and_wait();
            }
        }
    };

    std::vector<std::jthread> threads;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(worker, i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## `std::latch` Example: Startup Synchronization

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <latch>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <syncstream>

int main() {
    constexpr int num_workers = 4;
    std::latch startup_latch(num_workers + 1);
    std::latch done_latch(num_workers);

    std::vector<std::jthread> workers;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_workers; ++i) {
        workers.emplace_back([&startup_latch, &done_latch, i] {
            std::osyncstream(std::cout) << "Worker " << i << " initializing\n";
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100 * (i + 1)));
            std::osyncstream(std::cout) << "Worker " << i << " ready\n";
            startup_latch.count_down();

            startup_latch.wait();

            std::osyncstream(std::cout) << "Worker " << i << " processing\n";
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50));
            done_latch.count_down();
        });
    }

    startup_latch.wait();
    std::cout << "All workers initialized. Starting work.\n";

    done_latch.wait();
    std::cout << "All workers finished.\n";
    return 0;
}
```

`std::barrier` when you need reusable phase synchronization. `std::latch` is ideal for
Startup/shutdown patterns and fork-join parallelism [N4950 §31.4.4.3].
</aside>
## `std::flex_barrier` (C++20 Alternative)

C++20's `std::barrier` with a completion function that returns the next phase's expected count
Effectively creates a "flex barrier." The completion function can return a new thread count:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <barrier>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Completion function returns the next phase's thread count
    std::barrier b(4, [] noexcept -> std::ptrdiff_t {
        std::cout << "Phase done. Next phase expects 2 threads.\n";
        return 2;  // Reduce expected threads for next phase
    });

    auto worker = [&](int id) {
        std::cout << "Thread " << id << " arriving at phase 1\n";
        b.arrive_and_wait();
        if (id < 2) {
            std::cout << "Thread " << id << " arriving at phase 2\n";
            b.arrive_and_wait();
        }
    };

    std::vector<std::jthread> threads;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(worker, i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Choosing Between Synchronization Primitives

| Requirement                         | Primitive                              | Rationale                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| One-time wait for N events          | `std::latch`                           | Single-use, no reset needed     |
| Reusable phase synchronization      | `std::barrier`                         | Resets automatically per phase  |
| Wait for a condition to become true | `std::condition_variable`              | Flexible, works with predicates |
| Wait for a single event (flag)      | `std::atomic<bool>` + `wait()` (C++20) | No mutex overhead               |
| One-time initialization             | `std::call_once`                       | Guaranteed single execution     |

## Intuition

**A condition variable is like a doorbell for a waiting room:** When you're waiting for something to happen (like a package delivery), you don't want to keep checking the door every second. Instead, you ring the doorbell when the package arrives, and the waiting person wakes up. The predicate is like a security check — even if someone rings the bell, you still verify the package is actually there before getting excited (because of spurious wakeups, the doorbell might ring randomly).

**Why it matters:** Condition variables are the bridge between "I need to wait for something" and "I need to be notified when it's ready." Without them, you'd either waste CPU spinning in a loop or miss notifications entirely. They're the backbone of producer-consumer patterns, thread pools, and any scenario where threads need to coordinate based on changing state.

**The key insight:** Always use the predicate version of `wait()` — without it, spurious wakeups will cause your code to process data that isn't actually ready.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Forgetting the Predicate Loop

The single most common bug with condition variables is using `wait(lock)` without a predicate:

```cpp
// BUG: May wake up spuriously before the condition is actually met
cv.wait(lock);
process_data();

// FIX: Always use the predicate version
cv.wait(lock, [] { return data_ready; });
process_data();
```

Without the predicate, a spurious wakeup causes `process_data()` to run with invalid state. This is
A race condition that is extremely difficult to reproduce because on timing.

### Pitfall 2: Notify Without Holding the Lock

While it is correct to notify after releasing the lock (for performance), you must ensure the shared
State modification is protected by the lock:

```cpp
// WRONG: modifying state without lock
ready = true;
cv.notify_one();

// CORRECT: modify under lock, notify outside
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mtx_);
    ready = true;
}
cv.notify_one();
```

### Pitfall 3: Using `notify_all` When `notify_one` Suffices

`notify_all` wakes every waiting thread, which causes a "thundering herd" problem: all threads wake
Up, contend for the mutex, and all but one go back to sleep. Use `notify_one` when only one waiting
Thread can make progress:

```cpp
// Producer-consumer: only one consumer should wake per item
cv_.notify_one();  // Correct

// State change that enables multiple waiters to proceed
cv_.notify_all();  // Correct: all waiters can now proceed
```

### Pitfall 4: `std::latch` Count Underflow

Calling `count_down()` more times than the initial count is undefined behavior. The count is an
unsigned integer and wraps around, causing `wait()` to never return:

```cpp
std::latch l(2);
l.count_down();
l.count_down();  // Count is now 0
// l.count_down();  // UB: count underflows, latch may never reach zero
l.wait();  // Returns immediately (count is already 0)
```

### Pitfall 5: `std::barrier` with Unequal Thread Counts

If fewer threads arrive at a barrier than the expected count, the waiting threads block forever.
This is a common bug when worker threads exit early (e.g., due to exceptions):

```cpp
std::barrier b(4);

auto worker = [&b, id = 0](int id) mutable {
