Legacy CMake (versions pre-3.0) relied on global state variables and directory-scope commands (e.g.,
`include_directories``add_definitions`). This approach prevents modularity and leaks compilation
Flags across unrelated parts of a project.

**Modern CMake** (3.0+) is strictly **Target-Centric**. It models the build process as a directed
Acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes are **Targets** (executables, libraries) and edges are
**Properties** (compiler flags, include paths) that propagate according to strict rules.

## The Target-Centric Model

A **Target** represents a build artifact or a logical grouping of dependencies.

### 1. Defining Targets

```cmake
## 1. Executable: Compiles sources into a binary
add_executable(App main.cpp)

## 2. Static Library: Compiles into .a (Linux) or .lib (Windows)
add_library(MathStatic STATIC math.cpp)

# 3. Shared Library: Compiles into .so (Linux), .dylib (macOS), or .dll (Windows)
add_library(MathShared SHARED math.cpp)

# 4. Interface Library: A collection of properties/headers (No source files)
# Common for C++ template libraries or header-only libraries.
add_library(MathHeaderOnly INTERFACE)
```

### 2. Transitive Usage Requirements (Scopes)

The core mechanism of Modern CMake is the propagation of build requirements. When linking libraries,
You must specify the scope of the dependency.

| Scope         | Definition                                                                                | Use Case                                                                         |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PRIVATE**   | **Build Requirement.** Used internally to build the target, but not exposed to consumers. | Implementation details (e.g., a specific math algorithm used inside a function). |
| **INTERFACE** | **Usage Requirement.** Not used to build the target itself, but required by consumers.    | Header-only libraries, or headers defining template interfaces.                  |
| **PUBLIC**    | **Both.** Used to build the target AND required by consumers.                             | Public headers included in the library"s public headers.                         |

#### Implementation Example

```cmake
add_library(Engine src/engine.cpp)
add_library(Graphics src/graphics.cpp)
add_library(InternalUtils src/utils.cpp)

# 1. Engine uses Graphics in its public headers (e.g., engine.h includes graphics.h)
# Any target linking Engine MUST also know about Graphics include paths.
target_link_libraries(Engine PUBLIC Graphics)

# 2. Engine uses InternalUtils only inside engine.cpp.
# Consumers of Engine do not need to know InternalUtils exists.
target_link_libraries(Engine PRIVATE InternalUtils)

# 3. Configuring Include Directories
target_include_directories(Engine
    PUBLIC include        # Exposed to consumers
    PRIVATE src/internal  # Hidden from consumers
)
```

}
</script>

## Target Properties

Properties define how a target is built. Instead of modifying global flags (`CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`),
Modify target-specific properties.

### Standard C++ Versioning

Do not use compiler flags (`-std=c++23`) directly. Use compile features to ensure compiler-agnostic
Configuration.

```cmake
target_compile_features(Engine PUBLIC cxx_std_23)
```

### Preprocessor Definitions

```cmake
target_compile_definitions(Engine
    PRIVATE
        ENGINE_IMPL_DEBUG=1  # Only defined when compiling Engine source
    PUBLIC
        ENGINE_ENABLE_LOGGING # Defined for Engine and all consumers
)
```

### Standard Layout

To enforce standard layout rules across different compilers:

```cmake
set_target_properties(Engine PROPERTIES
    CXX_STANDARD 23
    CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON
    CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF  # Disable GNU/MSVC extensions (strict ISO)
    POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON # Required for shared libraries
)
```

}

## Generator Expressions

Generator Expressions are a DSL (Domain Specific Language) evaluated **during build system
Generation**, not during CMake configuration. They allow logic based on the build configuration
(Debug/Release), target platform, or compiler ID.

Syntax: `$<CONDITION:VALUE>`

### Common Use Cases

#### 1. Configuration-Specific Flags

Apply optimization flags only in Release builds, and debug flags only in Debug builds.

```cmake
target_compile_options(Engine PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:-g -O0>
    $<$<CONFIG:Release>:-O3 -march=native>
)
```

#### 2. Compiler-Specific Flags

Apply flags based on the compiler ID (Clang, GNU, MSVC).

```cmake
target_compile_options(Engine PRIVATE
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>:/W4 /permissive->
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:Clang>:-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic>
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU>:-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic>
)
```

#### 3. Build vs. Install Interface

When distributing a library, consumers need different include paths than the developer building the
Library.

- **BUILD_INTERFACE:** Used when building from source.
- **INSTALL_INTERFACE:** Used when installed (e.g., to `/usr/local/include`).

```cmake
target_include_directories(Engine PUBLIC
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
)
```

## Architectural Example: A Complete Module

Below is a `CMakeLists.txt` for a strict C++23 library component following best practices.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
project(CoreSystem LANGUAGES CXX)

# 1. Define the Target
add_library(CoreSystem) # Let CMake decide Static/Shared based on BUILD_SHARED_LIBS

# 2. Add Sources
target_sources(CoreSystem
    PRIVATE
        src/logger.cpp
        src/memory.cpp
)

# 3. Define Includes (Separating Interface and Implementation)
target_include_directories(CoreSystem
    PUBLIC
        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
        $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
    PRIVATE
        src/internal_headers
)

# 4. Define C++ Standard
target_compile_features(CoreSystem PUBLIC cxx_std_23)

# 5. Define Dependencies
find_package(fmt REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(CoreSystem
    PUBLIC
        fmt::fmt  # Public because CoreSystem headers include fmt headers
    PRIVATE
        Threads::Threads
)

# 6. Compiler Warnings (Using GenEx for Portability)
target_compile_options(CoreSystem PRIVATE
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>:/W4 /WX>
    $<$<NOT:$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>>:-Wall -Wextra -Werror>
)
```

## Graph Visualization

To verify the dependency graph constructed by your targets and properties, use Graphviz.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build --graphviz=graph.dot
dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png
```

This generates a visual representation of the DAG, allowing you to verify that `PRIVATE` and
`PUBLIC` linkages are propagating correctly.

## ALIAS Targets

ALIAS targets provide an indirection layer. They allow consumers to reference a target by a stable
Name regardless of how the underlying target was defined (static, shared, or object library).

```cmake
# Define the real target
add_library(MyLib STATIC src/lib.cpp)

# Create an alias
add_library(MyCompany::MyLib ALIAS MyLib)

# Consumers use the namespaced alias
target_link_libraries(App PRIVATE MyCompany::MyLib)
```

### Why ALIAS Matters

1. **Encapsulation:** Consumers never need to know whether `MyLib` is static or shared. The
   `CMakeLists.txt` can change from `STATIC` to `SHARED` without modifying any consumer.
2. **Namespace convention:** Using `Namespace::Target` follows the same convention as `find_package`
   exported targets (e.g., `fmt::fmt``Boost::system`), providing a uniform interface.
3. **Subdirectory isolation:** If `MyLib` is defined in a subdirectory, targets outside that
   subdirectory cannot reference it directly (by name) unless an alias is created in the parent
   scope.

**Constraint:** ALIAS targets cannot be used in `target_link_libraries` with `INTERFACE` or
`PRIVATE` visibility if the alias was created in a different directory scope. Always create the
Alias in the same scope or a parent scope where it will be consumed.

## OBJECT Libraries

OBJECT libraries compile source files into object files (`.o` / `.obj`) but do not archive them into
A static library or link them into a shared library. The object files are consumed by other targets.

```cmake
# Compile common utilities into object files
add_library(CommonObjects OBJECT
    src/utils.cpp
    src/logger.cpp
)

# Multiple targets can consume the same objects
add_library(StaticLib STATIC $<TARGET_OBJECTS:CommonObjects>)
add_executable(App1 src/app1.cpp $<TARGET_OBJECTS:CommonObjects>)
add_executable(App2 src/app2.cpp $<TARGET_OBJECTS:CommonObjects>)
```

### OBJECT Library Properties

Properties on OBJECT libraries do not propagate to consumers via `target_link_libraries`. Instead,
The consumer inherits only the object files. If `CommonObjects` has `PUBLIC` include directories,
Consumers linking `$<TARGET_OBJECTS:CommonObjects>` will **not** see those includes. You must
Explicitly apply the properties:

```cmake
add_library(CommonObjects OBJECT src/utils.cpp)
target_include_directories(CommonObjects PUBLIC include)

# App1 needs the includes explicitly
add_executable(App1 src/app1.cpp $<TARGET_OBJECTS:CommonObjects>)
target_include_directories(App1 PRIVATE include)  # Must duplicate
```

This is a known limitation of OBJECT libraries. For shared include directories across multiple
Consumers, prefer an INTERFACE library (described below).

## INTERFACE Libraries in Depth

INTERFACE libraries are pure property containers. They have no compiled output — they exist solely
To propagate build requirements to their consumers.

```cmake
# A header-only library
add_library(HeaderOnlyLib INTERFACE)

target_include_directories(HeaderOnlyLib INTERFACE include)
target_compile_features(HeaderOnlyLib INTERFACE cxx_std_23)

# A "meta-library" that bundles requirements
add_library(StrictWarnings INTERFACE)
target_compile_options(StrictWarnings INTERFACE
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>:/W4 /WX /permissive->
    $<$<NOT:$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>>:-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror>
)
```

### INTERFACE Libraries for Compiler Sanitizers

A practical pattern is using INTERFACE libraries to encapsulate sanitizer flags:

```cmake
add_library(SanitizerAddress INTERFACE)
target_compile_options(SanitizerAddress INTERFACE -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer)
target_link_options(SanitizerAddress INTERFACE -fsanitize=address)

add_library(SanitizerUBSan INTERFACE)
target_compile_options(SanitizerUBSan INTERFACE -fsanitize=undefined)
target_link_options(SanitizerUBSan INTERFACE -fsanitize=undefined)

# Usage
add_executable(App src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(App PRIVATE SanitizerAddress)
```

This pattern is superior to modifying `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` because it applies sanitizers only to
Specific targets and integrates cleanly with the transitive dependency system.

## Advanced Generator Expressions

### Boolean and Logical Operators

Generator expressions support boolean logic for complex conditions:

```cmake
# Logical NOT
$<$<NOT:$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>>:-Wall>

# Logical AND
$<$<AND:$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:Clang>,$<PLATFORM_ID:Linux>>:-fsanitize=address>

# Logical OR
$<$<OR:$<CONFIG:Debug>,$<CONFIG:RelWithDebInfo>>:-g>

# Boolean output: 1 or 0
$<$<BOOL:${ENABLE_FEATURE}>:FEATURE_ENABLED>
```

### String Operations

```cmake
# Convert to upper/lower case
$<UPPER_CASE:${PROJECT_NAME}>
$<LOWER_CASE:${PROJECT_NAME}>

# String comparison
$<STREQUAL:${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE},Debug>
```

### Target-Based Expressions

Generator expressions can query properties of other targets:

```cmake
# Get the include directories of another target
$<TARGET_PROPERTY:OtherTarget,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>

# Get the output file of a target
$<TARGET_FILE:MyExecutable>

# Get the linker language of a target
$<TARGET_PROPERTY:MyLib,LINKER_LANGUAGE>

# Condition on whether a target exists
$<TARGET_EXISTS:OptionalTarget>
```

### Output-Related Expressions

```cmake
# Output directory
$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:App>

# Output name without extension
$<TARGET_NAME:App>

# Suffix (.exe on Windows, empty on Linux)
$<TARGET_SUFFIX:App>

# Useful for copy commands in custom targets
add_custom_command(TARGET App POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy
        $<TARGET_FILE:App>
        $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:App>/../deploy/$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:App>
)
```

### Link-Only Options

`target_link_options` (CMake 3.13+) allows setting linker-specific flags with generator expressions:

```cmake
# Link-only flags do not leak to dependent targets
target_link_options(Engine PRIVATE
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:Clang>:-fuse-ld=lld>
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU>:-fuse-ld=gold>
    $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>:/LTCG>
)

# Link-time optimization
target_link_options(Engine PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Release>:-flto>
)
```

## Transitive Dependency Resolution Rules

When target `A` links to target `B`The build properties propagate according to strict rules:

```
A links PRIVATE B:
  - A gets B's INTERFACE properties for compiling A's sources
  - A's consumers do NOT get any of B's properties

A links PUBLIC B:
  - A gets B's INTERFACE properties for compiling A's sources
  - A's consumers ALSO get B's INTERFACE properties

A links INTERFACE B:
  - A does NOT use B's properties for its own compilation
  - A's consumers get B's INTERFACE properties
```

### Property Propagation Chain

Consider a three-level dependency chain: `App` &rarr; `Engine` &rarr; `fmt`

```cmake
add_library(fmt INTERFACE)  # Simplified
target_compile_definitions(fmt INTERFACE FMT_HEADER_ONLY)

add_library(Engine src/engine.cpp)
target_link_libraries(Engine PUBLIC fmt)  # Engine's public headers use fmt

add_executable(App src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(App PRIVATE Engine)
```

The result:

- `Engine` sees `FMT_HEADER_ONLY` when compiling its sources.
- `App` sees `FMT_HEADER_ONLY` when compiling its sources (because `Engine` propagated it as
  PUBLIC).
- If a consumer links `App`They do **not** see `FMT_HEADER_ONLY` (because `App` linked `Engine` as
  PRIVATE).

### PRIVATE vs. INTERFACE Dependencies for Implementation Details

A common architectural mistake is making implementation-only dependencies PUBLIC:

```cmake
# BAD: spdlog is only used inside Engine's .cpp files
target_link_libraries(Engine PUBLIC spdlog)

# GOOD: spdlog is an implementation detail
target_link_libraries(Engine PRIVATE spdlog)
```

Making `spdlog` PUBLIC means every consumer of `Engine` — and every consumer of those consumers —
Must also be able to find `spdlog`. This creates a transitive dependency explosion that slows builds
And makes the project harder to integrate.

## `target_sources` with File Sets (CMake 3.23+)

CMake 3.23 introduced **file sets** for organizing source files by their role (headers, sources,
Modules):

```cmake
add_library(Engine)

target_sources(Engine
    PUBLIC
        FILE_SET public_headers
        TYPE HEADERS
        BASE_DIRS include
        FILES
            include/engine/engine.h
            include/engine/renderer.h
    PRIVATE
        src/engine.cpp
        src/renderer.cpp
)
```

File sets integrate with the install command to automatically install the correct headers:

```cmake
install(TARGETS Engine
    FILE_SET public_headers
)
```

This replaces the manual `install(DIRECTORY include/ DESTINATION include)` pattern and ensures that
Only headers declared in the file set are installed.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Mixing Global and Target Commands

Never mix legacy global commands with target-centric commands in the same project:

```cmake
# BAD: Global state leaks to all targets in the directory
include_directories(include)
add_definitions(-DDEBUG)

# GOOD: Target-specific properties
target_include_directories(Engine PUBLIC include)
target_compile_definitions(Engine PRIVATE DEBUG=1)
```

### 2. Generator Expression Evaluation Timing

Generator expressions are evaluated during the **build system generation** phase (when CMake
Produces Ninja files, Makefiles, or `.sln` files), not during the **configuration** phase. This
Means you cannot inspect generator expression results with `message()`:

```cmake
# This prints the literal string "$<CONFIG:Debug>", not "Debug"
message($<CONFIG:Debug>)

# To conditionally print, use CMake's if()
if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Debug")
    message("Building in Debug mode")
endif()
```

### 3. Missing `target_link_options` for Link Flags

Using `target_compile_options` for linker flags (like `-fuse-ld=lld`) is incorrect. Compiler options
Are passed during compilation; linker options require `target_link_options`:

```cmake
# BAD: -fuse-ld is a linker flag, not a compiler flag
target_compile_options(App PRIVATE -fuse-ld=lld)

# GOOD: Linker flags go through target_link_options
target_link_options(App PRIVATE -fuse-ld=lld)
```

### 4. INTERFACE Libraries Cannot Have Sources

INTERFACE libraries cannot have source files. If you need to share both properties and compiled
Objects, use an OBJECT library combined with an INTERFACE library:

```cmake
# WRONG
add_library(Combined INTERFACE)
target_sources(Combined src/impl.cpp)  # ERROR

# CORRECT: Separate concerns
add_library(CombinedObjects OBJECT src/impl.cpp)
add_library(CombinedProps INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(CombinedProps INTERFACE include)
```

### 5. Overriding Properties via `set_target_properties`

Use `set_target_properties` only for properties that do not have a dedicated `target_*` command. For
Example, setting `CXX_STANDARD` via `set_target_properties` is acceptable, but setting include
Directories this way is wrong:

```cmake
# WRONG: Include directories should use target_include_directories
set_target_properties(Engine PROPERTIES
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include"
)

# CORRECT
target_include_directories(Engine PUBLIC include)
```

The `target_*` commands handle transitive propagation correctly; `set_target_properties` does not.

## Summary

This topic covers the essential concepts and techniques related to cmake targets properties and
generator expressions, including key principles and practical applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- core concepts and definitions
- key principles and frameworks
- practical applications
- common techniques and methods
- evaluation and critical analysis

A thorough understanding of these concepts, combined with regular practice and review, is essential
for mastery of this topic.

## Worked Examples

Worked examples demonstrating the application of key concepts are covered in the detailed sub-pages
linked above.

## Intuition

CMake generates build files from a declarative configuration. Targets represent build artifacts (executables, libraries). Properties control compile flags, include paths, and dependencies. The generator expression system enables conditional configuration based on build type, platform, or compiler. Modern CMake emphasizes target-based design where properties propagate through dependency chains automatically.
