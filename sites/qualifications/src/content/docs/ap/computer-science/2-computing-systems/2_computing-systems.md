## The Internet and Computing Systems (CED Unit 4)

### Hardware Components

| Component        | Function                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| CPU              | Executes instructions, performs calculations   |
| RAM              | Volatile memory for currently running programs |
| Hard drive / SSD | Non-volatile storage for persistent data       |
| GPU              | Processes graphics and parallel computations   |
| Motherboard      | Connects all components                        |
| Power supply     | Provides electrical power                      |
| Input devices    | Keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera            |
| Output devices   | Monitor, speakers, printer                     |

### The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

The CPU continuously:

1. **Fetch:** Read the next instruction from memory (address in the program counter).
2. **Decode:** Interpret the instruction.
3. **Execute:** Perform the operation.
4. **Store:** Write the result back to memory or a register.

**Detailed step-by-step:**

1. The address in the **Program Counter (PC)** is copied to the **Memory Address Register (MAR)**.
2. The instruction at that address is fetched from memory into the **Memory Data Register (MDR)**.
3. The PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.
4. The instruction in the MDR is copied to the **Current Instruction Register (CIR)**.
5. The **Control Unit (CU)** decodes the instruction in the CIR.
6. The instruction is executed (ALU performs calculations, data is moved between registers).

**Worked Example.** Trace the FDE cycle when PC = 200 and memory[200] contains "ADD R1, R2" (add
Register R2 to register R1).

1. Fetch: MAR $\leftarrow$ 200, MDR $\leftarrow$ "ADD R1, R2", PC $\leftarrow$ 201, CIR $\leftarrow$
   "ADD R1, R2".
2. Decode: CU identifies this as an addition instruction. Source: R2, destination: R1.
3. Execute: ALU computes R1 + R2, result stored in R1.

### Binary and Data Representation

Computers represent all data in binary (0s and 1s).

| Data Type | Representation                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Integer   | Two's complement (signed integers)   |
| Character | ASCII (7-bit) or Unicode (16+ bit)   |
| Color     | RGB values (24 bits, 8 per channel)  |
| Image     | Grid of pixels, each with RGB values |
| Audio     | Sampled amplitude values             |

#### Two's Complement

For an $n$-bit number:

- Range: $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1} - 1$
- 8-bit: $-128$ to $127$
- 16-bit: $-32768$ to $32767$
- 32-bit: $-2147483648$ to $2147483647$

**Negation:** Flip all bits and add 1.

:::info[Example]

Represent $-42$ in 8-bit two's complement.

$42$ in binary: $00101010$.

Flip bits: $11010101$.

Add 1: $11010110$.

**Verification:** $11010110 = -128 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = -128 + 86 = -42$. Correct.

:::

**Worked Example.** Represent $-100$ in 8-bit two's complement.

$100 = 01100100$.

Flip: $10011011$.

Add 1: $10011100$.

Verify: $-128 + 16 + 8 + 4 = -100$. Correct.

**Why two's complement is preferred.** Two's complement has the useful property that addition and
Subtraction use the same circuitry. To subtract $a - b$You add $a$ to the two's complement Of $b$.
There is no separate subtraction circuit needed.

**Proof of two's complement negation.** For $n$-bit $x$ where $0 \lt x \le 2^{n-1}$Let $\bar{x}$ Be
the bitwise complement. Then $\bar{x} = (2^n - 1) - x$. Adding 1: $\bar{x} + 1 = 2^n - x$. In
$n$-bit arithmetic, $2^n \equiv 0$So $x + (\bar{x} + 1) = 0$Confirming $\bar{x} + 1 = -x$.
$\blacksquare$

**Overflow detection.** If adding two positive numbers produces a negative result (or vice versa),
Overflow has occurred. The sign bit flips unexpectedly. Java does not throw an exception for integer
Overflow -- the result wraps around.

**Worked Example.** Compute $100 + 50$ in 8-bit two's complement.

$100 = 01100100$, $50 = 00110010$.

Sum: $10010110$.

The MSB is 1, indicating a negative result. $10010110 = -128 + 16 + 4 + 2 = -106$. This is incorrect
($100 + 50 = 150$Which exceeds the 8-bit range). Overflow has occurred.

#### Hexadecimal

Base-16 representation, using digits 0--9 and A--F.

| Binary | Hex | Decimal |
| ------ | --- | ------- |
| 0000   | 0   | 0       |
| 0001   | 1   | 1       |
| 0010   | 2   | 2       |
| 0011   | 3   | 3       |
| 0100   | 4   | 4       |
| 0101   | 5   | 5       |
| 0110   | 6   | 6       |
| 0111   | 7   | 7       |
| 1000   | 8   | 8       |
| 1001   | 9   | 9       |
| 1010   | A   | 10      |
| 1011   | B   | 11      |
| 1100   | C   | 12      |
| 1101   | D   | 13      |
| 1110   | E   | 14      |
| 1111   | F   | 15      |

Conversion: group binary digits in groups of 4 from right to left.

$10110110_2 = \mathrm{B6_{16}$

**Uses of hexadecimal:** Colour codes (#RRGGBB in HTML/CSS), memory addresses, MAC addresses, error
Codes, assembly language.

**Worked Example.** Convert `FF` from hexadecimal to binary and decimal.

Binary: $11111111$. Decimal: $15 \times 16 + 15 = 255$.

**Worked Example.** Convert `3A7` from hexadecimal to decimal.

$3 \times 256 + 10 \times 16 + 7 = 768 + 160 + 7 = 935$.

#### Representing Images

An image is a grid of pixels. Each pixel's colour is represented by binary values.

- **Colour depth:** Number of bits per pixel (1 bit = 2 colours, 24 bits = 16,777,216 colours).
- **Resolution:** Width $\times$ height in pixels.

$$\mathrm{File size (bits) = \mathrm{width \times \mathrm{height \times \mathrm{colour depth$$

**Worked example.** A $1920 \times 1080$ image with 24-bit colour:

$$1920 \times 1080 \times 24 = 49766400 \mathrm{ bits \approx 5.93 \mathrm{ MB$$

#### Representing Sound

Sound is digitised by sampling the amplitude of an analogue wave at regular intervals.

- **Sample rate:** Samples per second (Hz). CD quality: 44,100 Hz.
- **Bit depth:** Bits per sample. CD quality: 16-bit.
- **Channels:** Mono (1) or stereo (2).

$$\mathrm{File size (bits) = \mathrm{sample rate \times \mathrm{bit depth \times \mathrm{duration \times \mathrm{channels$$

**Worked Example.** A 2-minute stereo recording at 48000 Hz with 16-bit depth.

$48000 \times 16 \times 120 \times 2 = 184320000$ bits $\approx 22$ MB.

## Logic Gates and Boolean Logic (CED Unit 4)

### Basic Gates

| Gate | Symbol   | Boolean Expression     | Truth Table                 |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| AND  | A AND B  | A $\cdot$ B            | 1 only if both inputs are 1 |
| OR   | A OR B   | A + B                  | 0 only if both inputs are 0 |
| NOT  | NOT A    | $\bar{A}$              | Inverts input               |
| NAND | A NAND B | $\overline{A \cdot B}$ | NOT AND                     |
| NOR  | A NOR B  | $\overline{A + B}$     | NOT OR                      |
| XOR  | A XOR B  | $A \oplus B$           | 1 if inputs differ          |

### Truth Tables

**AND gate:**

| A   | B   | A AND B |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 0       |
| 1   | 0   | 0       |
| 1   | 1   | 1       |

**XOR gate:**

| A   | B   | A XOR B |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 1       |
| 1   | 0   | 1       |
| 1   | 1   | 0       |

### De Morgan's Laws

$$\overline{A \cdot B} = \bar{A} + \bar{B}$$

$$\overline{A + B} = \bar{A} \cdot \bar{B}$$

**Intuition.** De Morgan's Laws say that the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the
Negations, and vice versa. "It is not true that both A and B are true" is equivalent to "A is false
Or B is false."

**Application in circuit design.** If you need a NOR gate but only have NAND gates available, De
Morgan's Laws let you convert between gate types.

**Worked Example.** Simplify $\overline{A \cdot \bar{B}}$ using De Morgan's Laws.

$\overline{A \cdot \bar{B}} = \bar{A} + \overline{\bar{B}} = \bar{A} + B$.

**Proof of De Morgan's first law by truth table:**

| A   | B   | $A \cdot B$ | $\overline{A \cdot B}$ | $\bar{A}$ | $\bar{B}$ | $\bar{A} + \bar{B}$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- | ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0           | 1                      | 1         | 1         | 1                   |
| 0   | 1   | 0           | 1                      | 1         | 0         | 1                   |
| 1   | 0   | 0           | 1                      | 0         | 1         | 1                   |
| 1   | 1   | 1           | 0                      | 0         | 0         | 0                   |

Columns 4 and 7 are identical. $\blacksquare$

### Constructing Circuits

Any Boolean function can be implemented using only NAND gates or only NOR gates (functional
Completeness).

:::info[Example]

Implement XOR using AND, OR, and NOT gates.

$A \oplus B = (A \cdot \bar{B}) + (\bar{A} \cdot B)$

This requires: 2 NOT gates, 2 AND gates, 1 OR gate.

**Truth table verification:**

| A   | B   | $\bar{A}$ | $\bar{B}$ | $A \cdot \bar{B}$ | $\bar{A} \cdot B$ | $A \oplus B$ |
| --- | --- | --------- | --------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 0   | 0   | 1         | 1         | 0                 | 0                 | 0            |
| 0   | 1   | 1         | 0         | 0                 | 1                 | 1            |
| 1   | 0   | 0         | 1         | 1                 | 0                 | 1            |
| 1   | 1   | 0         | 0         | 0                 | 0                 | 0            |

:::

### Half Adder and Full Adder

**Half adder:** Adds two single bits. Produces sum and carry.

$$\mathrm{Sum = A \oplus B$$

$$\mathrm{Carry = A \cdot B$$

**Full adder:** Adds two bits and a carry-in. Produces sum and carry-out.

$$\mathrm{Sum = A \oplus B \oplus C_{\mathrm{in}$$

$$C_{\mathrm{out} = (A \cdot B) + (C_{\mathrm{in} \cdot (A \oplus B))$$

**Why full adders matter.** A full adder can be chained to add multi-bit numbers. To add two 8-bit
Numbers, chain 8 full adders: the carry-out of each stage becomes the carry-in of the next. The
Final carry-out is the 9th bit of the result.

**Worked Example.** Add 0110 and 0011 using half adders and full adders.

| Position  | 3 (MSB) | 2   | 1   | 0 (LSB) |
| --------- | ------- | --- | --- | ------- |
| A         | 0       | 1   | 1   | 0       |
| B         | 0       | 0   | 1   | 1       |
| Carry in  | 0       | 0   | 1   | 0       |
| Sum       | 0       | 1   | 0   | 1       |
| Carry out | 0       | 0   | 1   | 0       |

Result: $01001 = 9$. Check: $6 + 3 = 9$. Correct.

## Operating Systems (CED Unit 4)

An operating system (OS) manages hardware and provides services for applications.

### Functions of an OS

1. **Process management:** Schedules and manages running programs (processes).
2. **Memory management:** Allocates memory to processes, virtual memory, paging.
3. **File system management:** Organizes, stores, and retrieves files.
4. **Device management:** Controls hardware devices through drivers.
5. **User interface:** Provides a way for users to interact with the computer (GUI or CLI).
6. **Security:** Authentication, authorization, access control.

**Virtual memory.** When RAM is full, the OS swaps inactive pages to disk. A **page fault** occurs
When the CPU accesses data that has been swapped out. The OS loads the required page from disk into
RAM, which is much slower than a RAM access.

**Worked Example.** A computer has 4 GB of RAM. Programs require 6 GB total. The OS uses 2 GB of
Virtual memory on the SSD. What happens when a program accesses data in virtual memory?

A page fault occurs. The OS suspends the program, loads the required page from the SSD into RAM
(swapping out a less recently used page if necessary), and resumes the program. This takes
Milliseconds instead of nanoseconds, causing a noticeable delay.

### Types of Operating Systems

| Type      | Examples              | Characteristics               |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Desktop   | Windows, macOS, Linux | Personal use, multitasking    |
| Mobile    | iOS, Android          | Touch-optimized, app-based    |
| Server    | Windows Server, Linux | Network services, high uptime |
| Embedded  | RTOS, firmware        | Limited resources, dedicated  |
| Real-time | VxWorks, FreeRTOS     | Guaranteed response times     |

### The Role of the Kernel

The **kernel** is the core part of the OS that runs with full hardware access. It manages memory,
Processes, and devices. User applications run in **user mode** with restricted access; system calls
Request the kernel to perform privileged operations on their behalf.

## Software Development (CED Unit 5)

### The Development Life Cycle

1. **Requirements analysis:** Understand what the software should do.
2. **Design:** Plan the architecture and algorithms.
3. **Implementation:** Write the code.
4. **Testing:** Verify correctness and fix bugs.
5. **Deployment:** Release the software to users.
6. **Maintenance:** Update and fix issues over time.

### Software Testing

| Type                | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Unit testing        | Testing individual components                    |
| Integration testing | Testing interactions between components          |
| System testing      | Testing the entire system                        |
| Acceptance testing  | Testing against user requirements                |
| Black-box testing   | Testing based on inputs/outputs (no code access) |
| White-box testing   | Testing based on internal code structure         |

**Black-box vs white-box.** Black-box testing verifies that the system produces correct outputs for
Given inputs, without examining the code. White-box testing examines the code structure to ensure
Every path is tested (e.g., every branch of every `if` statement).

**Worked Example.** A function `isValidAge(age)` returns true if 0 $\le$ age $\le$ 120.

Black-box tests: age = -1 (invalid), 0 (boundary, valid), 60 (normal, valid), 120 (boundary, valid),
121 (invalid), 200 (invalid).

White-box tests: additionally verify each branch of the if statement is taken.

### Version Control

- Tracks changes to source code over time.
- Enables collaboration (multiple developers).
- Supports branching and merging.
- Common tools: Git, Subversion.

**Git concepts.** A **repository** is a project folder tracked by Git. A **commit** is a snapshot of
The project at a point in time. A **branch** is an independent line of development. A **pull
Request** proposes merging one branch into another.

## Additional Topics

### Representing Negative Numbers in Programming

In Java, `int` is a 32-bit two's complement integer. The range is $-2147483648$ to $2147483647$.

**Worked Example.** What happens when you compute `2000000000 + 2000000000` in Java?

$2000000000 + 2000000000 = 4000000000$. This exceeds $2^{31} - 1 = 2147483647$. In 32-bit two's
Complement, the result wraps around to $4000000000 - 2^{32} = -294967296$.

### Bitwise Operators in Java

| Operator   | Name        | Description                            |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `&`        | AND         | Bitwise AND                            |
| `\|`       | OR          | Bitwise OR                             |
| `^`        | XOR         | Bitwise XOR                            |
| `~`        | NOT         | Bitwise complement (inverts all bits)  |
| `&lt;&lt;` | Left shift  | Shifts bits left, fills with zeros     |
| `&gt;&gt;` | Right shift | Shifts bits right, fills with sign bit |

```java
int a = 12;   // 00001100
int b = 10;   // 00001010
int c = a & b; // 00001000 = 8
int d = a | b; // 00001110 = 14
int e = a ^ b; // 00000110 = 6
```

### Character Encoding in Java

Java uses UTF-16 internally for `char`. ASCII characters (0--127) map directly to Unicode code
Points.

```java
char ch = 'A';        // Unicode code point 65
int codePoint = (int) ch;  // 65
char upper = (char) ('a' - 32);  // 'A'
```

### Comparing Storage Devices

| Metric      | HDD              | SSD             |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Read speed  | 50-200 MB/s      | 200-550 MB/s    |
| Write speed | 50-150 MB/s      | 200-500 MB/s    |
| Latency     | 5-10 ms          | 0.05-0.1 ms     |
| IOPS        | 100-200          | 5000-100000     |
| Cost per GB | Low              | Higher          |
| Durability  | Mechanical parts | No moving parts |
| Power usage | Higher           | Lower           |

IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) measures how many read/write operations a drive can
Perform per second. SSDs excel here due to having no moving parts.

### BIOS vs UEFI

**BIOS (Basic Input/Output System):** Legacy firmware interface. 16-bit, limited to 2.2 TB drives.

**UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface):** Modern replacement. 32-bit/64-bit, supports drives
Larger than 2.2 TB, secure boot, graphical interface.

## Number Systems and Conversions

### Decimal to Binary

Repeatedly divide by 2 and record remainders.

**Worked Example.** Convert $200_{10}$ to binary.

$200 / 2 = 100$ r 0, $100 / 2 = 50$ r 0, $50 / 2 = 25$ r 0, $25 / 2 = 12$ r 1, $12 / 2 = 6$ R 0,
$6 / 2 = 3$ r 0, $3 / 2 = 1$ r 1, $1 / 2 = 0$ r 1.

Reading bottom to top: $11001000_2$.

### Binary to Decimal

Multiply each bit by its position value and sum.

**Worked Example.** Convert $11010110_2$ to decimal.

$128 + 64 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 214$.

### Hexadecimal Conversions

**Worked Example.** Convert `3A7` from hex to decimal.

$3     imes 256 + 10     imes 16 + 7 = 768 + 160 + 7 = 935$.

**Worked Example.** Convert `FF` from hex to binary and decimal.

Binary: $11111111$. Decimal: $15     imes 16 + 15 = 255$.

### Binary Arithmetic

**Addition rules:**

| $0 + 0$ | $0 + 1$ | $1 + 0$ | $1 + 1$        |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| 0       | 1       | 1       | 10 (0 carry 1) |

**Worked Example.** Add 0110 and 0011.

$0110 + 0011 = 1001 = 9$. Check: $6 + 3 = 9$. Correct.

**Worked Example.** Add 1011 and 0110.

$1011 + 0110 = 10001 = 17$. Check: $11 + 6 = 17$. Correct.

## Operating Systems in Detail

### Process States

A process can be in one of several states:

1. **New:** Being created.
2. **Ready:** Waiting for CPU time.
3. **Running:** Currently executing on the CPU.
4. **Blocked/Waiting:** Waiting for I/O or a resource.
5. **Terminated:** Finished execution.

### Memory Management Techniques

**Paging:** Memory is divided into fixed-size pages. The OS maps virtual pages to physical frames.

**Segmentation:** Memory is divided into variable-size segments based on logical divisions (code,
Data, stack).

**Worked Example.** A process needs 12 KB but the OS uses 4 KB pages. How many pages are needed?

$12 / 4 = 3$ pages.

### File Systems

**File allocation methods:**

- **Contiguous:** Files stored in consecutive blocks. Fast access but causes fragmentation.
- **Linked:** Each block points to the next. No fragmentation but slow random access.
- **Indexed:** An index block contains pointers to all data blocks. Fast random access.

**Directory structures:**

- **Flat:** All files in one directory.
- **Hierarchical:** Tree structure with folders and subfolders (most common).

### Utility Programs

| Utility              | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Disk defragmenter    | Reorganises data on a HDD for faster access |
| Disk cleaner         | Removes unnecessary files to free up space  |
| Antivirus            | Detects and removes malware                 |
| Compression software | Compresses and decompresses files           |
| Backup software      | Creates copies of data for recovery         |
| Firewall             | Monitors and filters network traffic        |

**Disk defragmentation.** On a HDD, files can become fragmented -- stored in non-contiguous clusters
Across the disk. This slows down reading because the read head must move to multiple locations.
Defragmentation reorganises files into contiguous blocks. Note: SSDs do not need defragmentation and
It can actually reduce their lifespan.

## Logic Circuits in Practice

### Constructing a Half Adder

A half adder adds two single bits:

$$ ext{Sum} = A \oplus B$$
$$ ext{Carry} = A \cdot B$$

**Implementation using basic gates:** 1 XOR gate (sum), 1 AND gate (carry).

### Constructing a Full Adder

A full adder adds two bits and a carry-in:

$$ ext{Sum} = A \oplus B \oplus C\*{ ext{in}}$$

$$
C*{ ext{out}} = (A \cdot B) + (C\_{ ext{in}} \cdot
(A \oplus B))
$$

**Implementation:** 2 XOR gates, 2 AND gates, 1 OR gate.

**Worked Example.** Add $7$ and $5$ using full adders (4-bit).

| Position  | 3 (MSB) | 2   | 1   | 0 (LSB) |
| --------- | ------- | --- | --- | ------- |
| A         | 0       | 1   | 1   | 1       |
| B         | 0       | 1   | 0   | 1       |
| Carry in  | 0       | 1   | 0   | 0       |

| Carry out | 0       | 0   | 1   | 0       |

Result: $1100 = 12$. Check: $7 + 5 = 12$. Correct.

## Software Development in Detail

### Version Control with Git

Git tracks changes to source code over time. Key concepts:

- **Repository:** A project folder tracked by Git.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of the project at a point in time.
- **Branch:** An independent line of development.
- **Pull request:** Proposes merging one branch into another.
- **Clone:** Copy a remote repository to your local machine.

**Common Git commands:**

| Command               | Purpose                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `git init`            | Create a new repository     |
| `git add .`           | Stage all changes           |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Commit staged changes       |
| `git push`            | Upload commits to remote    |
| `git pull`            | Download and merge changes  |
| `git branch name`     | Create a new branch         |
| `git checkout branch` | Switch to a branch          |
| `git merge branch`    | Merge a branch into current |
| `git log`             | View commit history         |

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

   per second.
2. **Incorrect two's complement conversion.** Always flip all bits AND add 1.
3. **Confusing AND and OR in Boolean expressions.** AND requires both true; OR requires at least one
   true.
4. **Forgetting De Morgan's Laws.**
5. **Confusing hexadecimal digits.** A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, F = 15.
6. **Thinking the OS is the hardware.** The OS is software.
7. **Confusing process and thread.** A process is an instance of a program; a thread is a
   lightweight unit of execution within a process.
8. **Forgetting that NAND and NOR are universal gates.** Any Boolean function can be built using
   only NAND gates or only NOR gates.
9. **Not padding binary groups of 4 when converting to hex.**

## Practice Problems

<details>
<summary>Question 1: Two's complement arithmetic</summary>

Perform the following 8-bit two's complement addition: $-50 + 30$. Show the binary representation of
each number, the addition, and determine whether overflow occurs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-50 in 8-bit two's complement: 50 = 00110010, invert = 11001101, add 1 = 11001110. 30 in 8-bit two's
complement: 00011110.

Addition: 11001110 + 00011110 = 11101100.

Convert result to decimal: 11101100 is negative (MSB = 1). Invert = 00010011, add 1 = 00010100 = 20.
So the result is -20.

Check: -50 + 30 = -20. Correct.

No overflow occurred because a negative and a positive number were added (overflow can only occur
when adding two numbers of the same sign).

<summary>Question 2: Logic circuit simplification</summary>

Simplify the Boolean expression
$\bar{A}\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C + \bar{A}\cdot B\cdot C + A\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C$ using Boolean algebra
identities.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

$\bar{A}\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C + \bar{A}\cdot B\cdot C + A\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C$

Factor out C from the first two terms:
$C(\bar{A}\cdot\bar{B} + \bar{A}\cdot B) + A\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C$

Factor out $\bar{A}$ from the parenthesised expression:
$C \cdot \bar{A}(\bar{B} + B) + A\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C$

Since $\bar{B} + B = 1$:
$C \cdot \bar{A} \cdot 1 + A\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C = \bar{A}\cdot C + A\cdot\bar{B}\cdot C$

Factor out C: $C(\bar{A} + A\cdot\bar{B})$

Using the distributive law: $C(\bar{A} + A)(\bar{A} + \bar{B})$

Wait -- that's incorrect. Let me redo: $C(\bar{A} + A \cdot \bar{B})$. This doesn't simplify further
using basic identities .

Alternative approach -- try consensus: $\bar{A}C + A\bar{B}C$. The consensus of $\bar{A}$ and
$\bar{B}$ with respect to $C$ is $\bar{A}\bar{B}$Which is not present, so no further simplification.

The simplified expression is:
$\bar{A} \cdot C + A \cdot \bar{B} \cdot C = C(\bar{A} + A \cdot \bar{B})$.

<details>
<summary>Question 3: Number conversion</summary>

Convert the decimal number 0.6875 to binary. Show the fractional conversion process.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Integer part: 0 = 0 in binary.

Fractional part: multiply by 2 repeatedly:

- 0.6875 $\times$ 2 = 1.375, digit = 1, remainder = 0.375
- 0.375 $\times$ 2 = 0.75, digit = 0, remainder = 0.75
- 0.75 $\times$ 2 = 1.5, digit = 1, remainder = 0.5
- 0.5 $\times$ 2 = 1.0, digit = 1, remainder = 0 (done)

Reading the digits top to bottom: 0.1011.

So 0.6875 in decimal = 0.1011 in binary.

Verification:
$1 \times 2^{-1} + 0 \times 2^{-2} + 1 \times 2^{-3} + 1 \times 2^{-4} = 0.5 + 0 + 0.125 + 0.0625 = 0.6875$.
Correct.

<summary>Question 4: File size calculation</summary>

A 5-minute video is recorded at 30 frames per second with a resolution of $1920 \times 1080$ pixels.
Each pixel uses 24 bits for colour (RGB). Calculate the file size in gigabytes before compression.
Express your answer to 2 significant figures.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Total frames: $30 \times 5 \times 60 = 9,000$ frames.

Pixels per frame: $1920 \times 1080 = 2,073,600$ pixels.

Bits per frame: $2,073,600 \times 24 = 49,766,400$ bits.

Total bits: $49,766,400 \times 9,000 = 447,897,600,000$ bits.

Convert to bytes: $447,897,600,000 / 8 = 55,987,200,000$ bytes.

Convert to GB:
$55,987,200,000 / (1024^3) = 55,987,200,000 / 1,073,741,824 \approx 52.15 \mathrm{ GB$.

Rounded to 2 significant figures: 52 GB. This demonstrates why video compression is essential.

<details>
<summary>Question 5: De Morgan's Laws application</summary>

Using De Morgan's Laws, convert the expression $\overline{A \cdot B + C \cdot D}$ into an expression
that uses only AND and NOT operations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

$\overline{A \cdot B + C \cdot D}$

Applying De Morgan's Law (distribute the NOT over the OR):
$= \overline{A \cdot B} \cdot \overline{C \cdot D}$

Applying De Morgan's Law to each term: $= (\bar{A} + \bar{B}) \cdot (\bar{C} + \bar{D})$

Wait -- the question asks for only AND and NOT. Let me apply the other form:

$\overline{A \cdot B + C \cdot D} = \overline{A \cdot B} \cdot \overline{C \cdot D}$

To express using only AND and NOT, note that $\overline{X + Y} = \bar{X} \cdot \bar{Y}$ (De
Morgan's). But the question says only AND and NOT. Since
$\overline{A \cdot B} = \overline{A} + \overline{B}$This introduces OR.

Using only NAND (AND + NOT): $\overline{A \cdot B} = \mathrm{NAND(A, B)$ and
$\overline{C \cdot D} = \mathrm{NAND(C, D)$.

So: $\mathrm{NAND(A, B) \cdot \mathrm{NAND(C, D)$ -- but this uses AND.

Actually, NAND(A, B) already uses AND and NOT: $\overline{A \cdot B}$. So the answer is:
$\overline{A \cdot B} \cdot \overline{C \cdot D}$Which uses only AND (implicit in the NOT-AND) and
NOT operations.
