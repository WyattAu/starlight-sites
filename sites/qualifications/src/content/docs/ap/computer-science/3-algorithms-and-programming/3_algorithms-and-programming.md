### Common Time Complexities

| Complexity    | Name         | Example                        |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| $O(1)$        | Constant     | Array access by index          |
| $O(\log n)$   | Logarithmic  | Binary search                  |
| $O(n)$        | Linear       | Linear search                  |
| $O(n \log n)$ | Linearithmic | Merge sort                     |
| $O(n^2)$      | Quadratic    | Selection sort, insertion sort |
| $O(2^n)$      | Exponential  | Recursive Fibonacci            |

### Formal Definition

$f(n) = O(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that $f(n) \le c \cdot g(n)$
For all $n \ge n_0$.

### Analyzing Code

**Rule 1:** Sequential statements: add complexities. $O(a) + O(b) = O(\max(a, b))$.

**Rule 2:** Nested loops: multiply complexities. $O(a) \times O(b) = O(a \cdot b)$.

**Rule 3:** Drop constants and lower-order terms. $O(3n^2 + 5n + 100) = O(n^2)$.

:::info[Example 1]

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        System.out.println(i + j);
    }
}
```

Total: $O(n) \times O(n) = O(n^2)$.


:::
:::info[Example 2]

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    System.out.println(j);
}
```

Total: $O(n) + O(n) = O(n)$.


## Recursion (AP CS A)

A method that calls itself. Every recursive solution must have:

1. **Base case(s):** The simplest case(s) that can be solved directly.
2. **Recursive case(s):** The method calls itself with a simpler (smaller) input.

### Example: Factorial

```java
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

**Proof of correctness by induction.** Base case: `factorial(0) = 1 = 0!`. Inductive step: assume
`factorial(k) = k!` for all $k \lt n$. Then `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1) = n * (n-1)! = n!`.
$\blacksquare$

### Example: Fibonacci (Inefficient)

```java
public static int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

Time complexity: $O(2^n)$ because each call spawns two subcalls with redundant computation.

**Efficient alternative:** $O(n)$ iterative approach:

```java
public static int fibIterative(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int a = 0, b = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int temp = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }
    return b;
}
```

### Example: String Reversal

```java
public static String reverse(String s) {
    if (s.length() <= 1) {
        return s;
    }
    return reverse(s.substring(1)) + s.charAt(0);
}
```

**Trace for `reverse("abcd")`:**

```
reverse("abcd") = reverse("bcd") + 'a'
reverse("bcd")  = reverse("cd") + 'b'
reverse("cd")   = reverse("d") + 'c'
reverse("d")    = "d"
reverse("cd")   = "dc"
reverse("bcd")  = "dcb"
reverse("abcd") = "dcba"
```

## Additional Topics

### Selection Sort Trace in Detail

**Trace of selection sort on [5, 3, 8, 1, 2]:**

| Pass | Array State     | Comparisons | Swaps |
| ---- | --------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 1    | [1, 3, 8, 5, 2] | 4           | 1     |
| 2    | [1, 2, 8, 5, 3] | 3           | 1     |
| 3    | [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] | 2           | 1     |
| 4    | [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] | 1           | 0     |

Total comparisons: $4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 = n(n-1)/2$ for $n = 5$.

### Insertion Sort Trace in Detail

**Trace of insertion sort on [4, 2, 7, 1, 3]:**

| Step | Array State     | Key | Shifts | Comparisons |
| ---- | --------------- | --- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1    | [4, 2, 7, 1, 3] | 2   | 1      | 1           |
| 2    | [4, 2, 7, 1, 3] | 7   | 0      | 1           |
| 3    | [4, 2, 7, 1, 3] | 1   | 3      | 3           |
| 4    | [1, 2, 4, 7, 3] | 3   | 0      | 1           |

Total comparisons: $1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6$.

### Merge Sort Trace in Detail

**Trace of merge sort on [38, 27, 43, 3]:**

Split: [38, 27] and [43, 3].

Sort [38, 27]: split into [38] and [27], merge to [27, 38]. Sort [43, 3]: split into [43] and [3],
Merge to [3, 43].

Merge [27, 38] and [3, 43]: [3, 27, 38, 43].

### Quick Sort Worst Case

Quick sort has $O(n^2)$ worst case when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element. This
Happens when the array is already sorted (or reverse sorted) and the first or last element is used
As the pivot.

**Mitigation:** Choose the middle element or a random element as the pivot.

### Comparing Iterative and Recursive Binary Search

**Iterative binary search uses $O(1)$ space.** The recursive version uses $O(\log n)$ stack space
Due to recursive calls.

```java
public static int binarySearchIterative(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Common Algorithm Design Patterns

**Divide and conquer:** Break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each recursively, combine
Results. Examples: merge sort, binary search.

**Greedy:** Make the locally optimal choice at each step. Examples: Dijkstra's shortest path,
Huffman coding, coin change (with standard denominations).

**Dynamic programming:** Solve overlapping subproblems by storing results in a table. Examples:
Fibonacci (with memoisation), knapsack problem, longest common subsequence.

**Worked Example.** Fibonacci with memoisation reduces $O(2^n)$ to $O(n)$.

```java
public static long fibMemo(int n) {
    long[] memo = new long[n + 1];
    memo[0] = 0;
    memo[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];
    }
    return memo[n];
}
```

## Merge Sort Trace in Detail

**Trace of merge sort on [38, 27, 43, 3]:**

Split: [38, 27] and [43, 3].

Sort [38, 27]: split into [38] and [27], merge to [27, 38]. Sort [43, 3]: split into [43] and [3],
Merge to [3, 43].

Merge [27, 38] and [3, 43]: [3, 27, 38, 43].

## Quick Sort

A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot, partitions elements around it, and recursively
Sorts each partition.

**Java implementation:**

```java
public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

private static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = low - 1;
    for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < pivot) {
            i++;
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
        }
    }
    int temp = arr[i + 1];
    arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
    arr[high] = temp;
    return i + 1;
}
```

**Quick Sort worst case.** $O(n^2)$ when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element. This
Happens when the array is already sorted (or reverse sorted) and the first or last element is used
As the pivot.

**Mitigation:** Choose the middle element or a random element as the pivot.

**Quick Sort trace on [5, 3, 8, 1, 2]:**

Pivot = 2 (last element). Partition: [1, 2, 8, 5, 3]. Pivot index = 1.

Sort [1]: single element, done.

Sort [8, 5, 3]: Pivot = 3. Partition: [3, 5, 8]. Pivot index = 2.

Sort [5, 8]: Pivot = 8. Partition: [5, 8]. Pivot index = 1.

Final: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

## Comparing Iterative and Recursive Binary Search

**Iterative binary search uses $O(1)$ space.** The recursive version uses $O(\log n)$ stack space
Due to recursive calls.

```java
public static int binarySearchIterative(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## Common Algorithm Design Patterns

**Divide and conquer:** Break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each recursively, combine
Results. Examples: merge sort, binary search.

**Greedy:** Make the locally optimal choice at each step. Examples: Dijkstra's shortest path,
Huffman coding, coin change (with standard denominations).

**Dynamic programming:** Solve overlapping subproblems by storing results in a table. Examples:

**Worked Example.** Fibonacci with memoisation reduces $O(2^n)$ to $O(n)$.

```java
public static long fibMemo(int n) {
    long[] memo = new long[n + 1];
    memo[0] = 0;
    memo[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];
    }
    return memo[n];
}
```

## String Algorithms

**Palindrome check (Java):**

```java
public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Time complexity:** $O(n)$ -- compares each pair of characters once.

**Proof of correctness.** The loop compares characters at symmetric positions: position 0 with
Position n-1, position 1 with position n-2, etc. If any pair differs, the string is not a palindrome
And the method returns false. If all pairs match, the string reads the same forwards and backwards,
So it is a palindrome. $lacksquare$

**String reversal (iterative):**

```java
public static String reverse(String s) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        sb.append(s.charAt(i));
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
```

**Time complexity:** $O(n)$ -- appends each character once.

## Array Algorithms

**Finding the mode (most frequent element):**

```java
public static int findMode(int[] arr) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    int mode = arr[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if (arr[j] == arr[i]) count++;
        }
        if (count > maxCount) {
            maxCount = count;
            mode = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return mode;
}
```

**Time complexity:** $O(n^2)$ -- nested loops.

**Two-pointer technique:**

```java
public static boolean hasPairWithSum(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if (sum == target) return true;
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Time complexity:** $O(n)$ -- requires a sorted array.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting the base case in recursion.** Causes infinite recursion and stack overflow.
2. **Confusing binary search with linear search.** Binary search requires a sorted array.
3. **Using selection sort or insertion sort for large datasets.** These $O(n^2)$ algorithms are too
   slow; use merge sort ($O(n \log n)$) instead.
4. **Off-by-one errors in binary search.** The condition is `low <= high` (inclusive).

   but $O(n)$ is the tightest (best) bound.
7. **Not recognizing that AP CSP pseudocode uses 1-based indexing** while Java uses 0-based
   indexing.
