# Integrals — Diagnostic Tests

## Unit Tests

> Tests edge cases, boundary conditions, and common misconceptions for integrals.

### UT-1: Riemann Sum Identification and Limit Conversion

**Question:**

A student encounters the limit:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{k^2}{n^3} \sqrt{4 - \frac{k^2}{n^2}}$$

(a) Express this limit as a definite integral. (b) Identify which type of Riemann sum (left, right,
midpoint, or trapezoidal) this represents, or state if it is ambiguous. (c) Evaluate the definite
integral.

**Solution:**

(a) Factor out $\frac{1}{n}$:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{k^2}{n^3}\sqrt{4 - \frac{k^2}{n^2}} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} \cdot \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2 \sqrt{4 - \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2}$$

With $\Delta x = \frac{1}{n}$ and $x_k = \frac{k}{n}$ (right endpoint of the $k$-th subinterval on
$[0, 1]$):

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} \cdot x_k^2 \sqrt{4 - x_k^2} = \int_0^1 x^2\sqrt{4 - x^2}\,dx$$

(b) Since $x_k = \frac{k}{n}$ uses the right endpoint of each subinterval, this is a **right Riemann
sum**.

(c) Use the substitution $x = 2\sin\theta$, $dx = 2\cos\theta\,d\theta$:

$$\int_0^1 x^2\sqrt{4-x^2}\,dx = \int_0^{\arcsin(1/2)} 4\sin^2\theta \cdot 2\cos\theta \cdot 2\cos\theta\,d\theta$$

$$= 16\int_0^{\pi/6} \sin^2\theta\cos^2\theta\,d\theta = 4\int_0^{\pi/6} \sin^2(2\theta)\,d\theta$$

Using $\sin^2(2\theta) = \frac{1 - \cos(4\theta)}{2}$:

$$= 4\int_0^{\pi/6}\frac{1 - \cos(4\theta)}{2}\,d\theta = 2\left[\theta - \frac{\sin(4\theta)}{4}\right]_0^{\pi/6}$$

$$= 2\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{\sin(2\pi/3)}{4}\right) = 2\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{4}\right) = \frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$$

### UT-2: Integration by Parts with LIATE Trap

**Question:**

Evaluate $\displaystyle\int e^{2x}\sin(3x)\,dx$.

A student chooses $u = \sin(3x)$ and $dv = e^{2x}\,dx$ for the first application of integration by
parts. Show that this choice works but leads to a longer computation than choosing $u = e^{2x}$.
Evaluate the integral completely using the more efficient choice and explain why "LIATE" alone does
not settle this choice.

**Solution:**

LIATE ranks: **L**ogarithmic, **I**nverse trig, **A**lgebraic, **T**rigonometric, **E**xponential.
Both $e^{2x}$ (Exponential) and $\sin(3x)$ (Trigonometric) are in the LIATE list. Trigonometric
comes before Exponential, so LIATE suggests $u = \sin(3x)$. But for products of exponentials and
trig functions, **either** choice works, and the key is to apply integration by parts **twice** and
solve algebraically.

Using $u = e^{2x}$, $dv = \sin(3x)\,dx$:

$du = 2e^{2x}\,dx$, $v = -\frac{1}{3}\cos(3x)$.

$$\int e^{2x}\sin(3x)\,dx = -\frac{1}{3}e^{2x}\cos(3x) + \frac{2}{3}\int e^{2x}\cos(3x)\,dx$$

Apply parts again to the remaining integral. Let $u = e^{2x}$, $dv = \cos(3x)\,dx$:

$du = 2e^{2x}\,dx$, $v = \frac{1}{3}\sin(3x)$.

$$\int e^{2x}\cos(3x)\,dx = \frac{1}{3}e^{2x}\sin(3x) - \frac{2}{3}\int e^{2x}\sin(3x)\,dx$$

Substituting back:

$$I = -\frac{1}{3}e^{2x}\cos(3x) + \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}e^{2x}\sin(3x) - \frac{2}{3}I\right)$$

$$I = -\frac{1}{3}e^{2x}\cos(3x) + \frac{2}{9}e^{2x}\sin(3x) - \frac{4}{9}I$$

$$\frac{13}{9}I = e^{2x}\left(-\frac{1}{3}\cos(3x) + \frac{2}{9}\sin(3x)\right)$$

$$I = \frac{e^{2x}}{13}(2\sin(3x) - 3\cos(3x)) + C$$

The misconception: students sometimes stop after one application of parts, or they choose a
different assignment for the second integration by parts (switching $u$ and $dv$), which creates a
circular argument instead of solving for $I$.

### UT-3: Area Between Curves When Functions Cross the x-Axis

**Question:**

Find the total area of the region bounded by $y = x^3 - 4x$ and $y = x^2 - 4$.

A student computes $\displaystyle\int_{-2}^{2}\left[(x^3 - 4x) - (x^2 - 4)\right]\,dx$ and gets the
wrong answer. Explain the error and compute the correct total area.

**Solution:**

First find intersection points: $x^3 - 4x = x^2 - 4 \implies x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$.

By inspection $x = 1$ is a root: $1 - 1 - 4 + 4 = 0$. Factoring:

$$(x-1)(x^2 - 4) = (x-1)(x-2)(x+2) = 0$$

Intersection points: $x = -2, 1, 2$.

The student's error: they integrated from $-2$ to $2$ without accounting for the curve crossing at
$x = 1$. On $[-2, 1]$We must determine which curve is on top; on $[1, 2]$The other may be on top.

Test point $x = 0$: $x^3 - 4x = 0$, $x^2 - 4 = -4$. So $x^3 - 4x \gt x^2 - 4$ on $[-2, 1]$.

Test point $x = 1.5$: $x^3 - 4x = 3.375 - 6 = -2.625$, $x^2 - 4 = 2.25 - 4 = -1.75$. So
$x^2 - 4 \gt x^3 - 4x$ on $[1, 2]$.

$$\text{Total area = \int_{-2}^{1}\left[(x^3 - 4x) - (x^2 - 4)\right]\,dx + \int_1^{2}\left[(x^2 - 4) - (x^3 - 4x)\right]\,dx$$

$$= \int_{-2}^{1}(x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4)\,dx + \int_1^{2}(-x^3 + x^2 + 4x - 4)\,dx$$

First integral:

$$\left[\frac{x^4}{4} - \frac{x^3}{3} - 2x^2 + 4x\right]_{-2}^{1} = \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{3} - 2 + 4\right) - \left(4 + \frac{8}{3} - 8 - 8\right)$$

$$= \frac{25}{12} - \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{25}{12} + \frac{80}{12} = \frac{105}{12} = \frac{35}{4}$$

Second integral:

$$\left[-\frac{x^4}{4} + \frac{x^3}{3} + 2x^2 - 4x\right]_1^{2} = \left(-4 + \frac{8}{3} + 8 - 8\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} + 2 - 4\right)$$

$$= -\frac{4}{3} - \left(-\frac{23}{12}\right) = -\frac{16}{12} + \frac{23}{12} = \frac{7}{12}$$

$$\text{Total area = \frac{35}{4} + \frac{7}{12} = \frac{105 + 7}{12} = \frac{112}{12} = \frac{28}{3}$$

The student's integral gives $\displaystyle\int_{-2}^{2}(x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4)\,dx = \frac{28}{3}$
only because the areas happen to be positive in both subintervals when separated correctly. The
student's single integral from $-2$ to $2$ actually evaluates to:

$$\int_{-2}^{2}(x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4)\,dx = \left[\frac{x^4}{4} - \frac{x^3}{3} - 2x^2 + 4x\right]_{-2}^{2}$$

This gives $\frac{28}{3}$ here too, but this is coincidental. The fundamental error is not splitting
at intersection points, which would give wrong answers .

### IT-1: Volume of Revolution with Washer and Shell Method Verification (with Derivatives)

**Question:**

Let $R$ be the region bounded by $y = \sqrt{x}$, $y = 0$And $x = 4$.

(a) Find the volume generated when $R$ is revolved about the line $x = 6$ using the **shell
method**. (b) Verify your answer using the **washer method**. (c) A student claims the volume about
$x = 6$ should be the same as the volume about the $y$-axis because "it's just a translation."
Explain why this is false, and compute the volume about the $y$-axis for comparison.

**Solution:**

(a) Shell method (parallel to axis of revolution): use horizontal shells.

A shell at height $y$ has radius $r = 6 - x = 6 - y^2$ and height $h = dy$ (thin strip). For shells,
we integrate along the axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution.

Since we revolve about $x = 6$ (vertical line), shells are vertical: radius $= 6 - x$Height
$= \sqrt{x} - 0 = \sqrt{x}$.

$$V = 2\pi\int_0^4 (6-x)\sqrt{x}\,dx = 2\pi\int_0^4 (6x^{1/2} - x^{3/2})\,dx$$

$$= 2\pi\left[4x^{3/2} - \frac{2}{5}x^{5/2}\right]_0^4 = 2\pi\left(4 \cdot 8 - \frac{2}{5} \cdot 32\right) = 2\pi\left(32 - \frac{64}{5}\right) = 2\pi \cdot \frac{96}{5} = \frac{192\pi}{5}$$

(b) Washer method: washers perpendicular to $x = 6$So we integrate with respect to $y$.

Outer radius: $R = 6 - 0 = 6$ (from $x = 6$ to the $y$-axis). More precisely, for washers
perpendicular to the axis $x = 6$: at height $y$The region extends from $x = y^2$ to $x = 4$.
Revolved about $x = 6$:

- Outer radius: $6 - y^2$ (from axis to the left edge of region at $x = y^2$)
- Inner radius: $6 - 4 = 2$ (from axis to the right edge of region at $x = 4$)

$$V = \pi\int_0^2\left[(6-y^2)^2 - 2^2\right]\,dy = \pi\int_0^2(36 - 12y^2 + y^4 - 4)\,dy$$

$$= \pi\int_0^2(32 - 12y^2 + y^4)\,dy = \pi\left[32y - 4y^3 + \frac{y^5}{5}\right]_0^2$$

$$= \pi\left(64 - 32 + \frac{32}{5}\right) = \pi\left(32 + \frac{32}{5}\right) = \frac{192\pi}{5}$$

(c) Volume about the $y$-axis (disk method):

$$V = \pi\int_0^4 (\sqrt{x})^2\,dx = \pi\int_0^4 x\,dx = \pi \cdot 8 = 8\pi$$

The volumes are different ($\frac{192\pi}{5} \approx 120.6$ vs $8\pi \approx 25.1$). Revolving about
a different axis changes the radius of every point, so the volume changes. The student's
"translation" argument is wrong because the region itself does not translate -- only the axis does,
which changes the distance from every point to the axis.

### IT-2: Improper Integral Convergence with Parameter (with Limits)

**Question:**

For what values of $p$ does the improper integral
$\displaystyle\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^{p-1}}{1 + x}\,dx$ converge?

Hint: Split the integral at $x = 1$ and analyze the behavior of each part separately using
comparison with $p$-integrals.

**Solution:**

Split at $x = 1$:
$\displaystyle\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^{p-1}}{1+x}\,dx = \int_0^1 \frac{x^{p-1}}{1+x}\,dx + \int_1^{\infty} \frac{x^{p-1}}{1+x}\,dx$

**Near $x = 0$** (first integral): When $x \in (0, 1)$, $\frac{1}{2} \lt \frac{1}{1+x} \lt 1$So:

$$\frac{x^{p-1}}{2} \lt \frac{x^{p-1}}{1+x} \lt x^{p-1}$$

By comparison with $\displaystyle\int_0^1 x^{p-1}\,dx$ (converges iff $p - 1 > -1$I.e., $p > 0$):

The first integral converges iff $p > 0$.

**As $x \to \infty$** (second integral): When $x > 1$,
$\frac{1}{2} \lt \frac{1}{1+x} \lt \frac{1}{x}$So:

$$\frac{x^{p-1}}{2} \lt \frac{x^{p-1}}{1+x} \lt x^{p-2}$$

By comparison with $\displaystyle\int_1^{\infty} x^{p-2}\,dx$ (converges iff $p - 2 \lt -1$I.e.,
$p \lt 1$):

The second integral converges iff $p \lt 1$.

**Conclusion:** The full integral converges iff both parts converge, i.e., $0 \lt p \lt 1$.

Note: this integral equals $B(p, 1-p) = \pi \csc(\pi p)$ (the beta function), which has the same
domain of convergence.

### IT-3: FTC Part 1 vs Part 2 Confusion with Piecewise Functions (with Continuity)

**Question:**

Let
$f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x & \text{if  0 \leq x \lt 2 \\ 8 - 2x & \text{if  2 \leq x \leq 4 \end{cases}$

Let $\displaystyle F(x) = \int_0^x f(t)\,dt$.

(a) Find and graph $F(x)$. (b) Is $F$ differentiable at $x = 2$? Compute $F'(2)$ from the definition
of the derivative and explain. (c) A student claims that since $f$ has a corner at $x = 2$, $F$ must
also have a corner at $x = 2$. Is this correct?

**Solution:**

(a) For $0 \leq x \lt 2$:

$$F(x) = \int_0^x 2t\,dt = t^2\Big|_0^x = x^2$$

For $2 \leq x \leq 4$:

$$F(x) = \int_0^2 2t\,dt + \int_2^x (8 - 2t)\,dt = 4 + \left[8t - t^2\right]_2^x = 4 + (8x - x^2 - 12) = -x^2 + 8x - 8$$

So
$F(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 & \text{if  0 \leq x \lt 2 \\ -x^2 + 8x - 8 & \text{if  2 \leq x \leq 4 \end{cases}$

(Note: $4 + (8x - x^2 - 12) = -x^2 + 8x - 8$Not $(x-4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16$. The two expressions
differ.)

(b) Check differentiability at $x = 2$:

$$F(2) = -4 + 16 - 8 = 4$$

Left-hand derivative:
$F'_{-}(2) = \lim_{h \to 0^-}\frac{F(2+h) - F(2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-}\frac{(2+h)^2 - 4}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-}\frac{4h + h^2}{h} = 4$.

Right-hand derivative:
$F'_{+}(2) = \lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{F(2+h) - F(2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{-(2+h)^2 + 8(2+h) - 8 - 4}{h}$

$= \lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{-4 - 4h - h^2 + 16 + 8h - 12}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{-h^2 + 4h}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+}(-h + 4) = 4$.

Since $4 = 4$, $F$ **is differentiable** at $x = 2$With $F'(2) = 4 = f(2)$.

(c) The student is **incorrect**. Although $f$ has a corner at $x = 2$ ($f$ changes from slope $+2$
to slope $-2$), $f$ is continuous at $x = 2$ ($f(2^-) = 4 = f(2^+)$). By FTC part 1, since $f$ is
continuous at $x = 2$, $F$ is differentiable at $x = 2$ with $F'(2) = f(2) = 4$. Integration
"smooths" the corner: $F$ is continuously differentiable even though $f$ is not.
