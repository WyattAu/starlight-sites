## 1. Programming Concepts

### 1.1 Variables and Constants

A **variable** is a named storage location whose value can change during program execution.

A **constant** is a named value that does not change once assigned.

```python
# Variables
age = 15
name = "Alice"
height = 1.65

# Constants (convention: UPPER_CASE)
PI = 3.14159
MAX_SCORE = 100
```

**Why use constants?** If a value like the VAT rate (20%) appears in many places in your code, using
A constant `VAT_RATE = 0.20` means you only need to change it in one place if the rate changes. This
Reduces errors and makes the code easier to maintain.

**Data types:**

| Type       | Description                 | Example          |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Integer    | Whole numbers               | 42, -7, 0        |
| Real/Float | Numbers with decimal places | 3.14, -0.5       |
| String     | Text enclosed in quotes     | "Hello", 'World' |
| Character  | A single character          | 'A', '7'         |
| Boolean    | True or False               | True, False      |

**Type casting** converts a value from one type to another:

```python
age_str = "15"
age_int = int(age_str)       # String to integer
price = 9.99
price_int = int(price)       # Float to integer (truncates to 9)
number = 42
number_str = str(number)     # Integer to string
```

### 1.2 Input and Output

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("Hello, " + name + ". You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
```

**Formatted output (f-strings):**

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 15
print(f"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.")
```

### 1.3 Selection

**IF statement:**

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote.")
elif age >= 16:
    print("You can work but not vote.")
else:
    print("You are too young.")
```

**Nested IF:**

```python
score = 75

if score >= 50:
    if score >= 70:
        print("Grade A")
    else:
        print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Fail")
```

**Nested IF pitfall.** In the example above, the inner `if score >= 70` only executes when
`score >= 50`. If `score = 80`The output is "Grade A". If `score = 60`The output is "Grade C". If
`score = 40`The output is "Fail". Think carefully about the nesting order to avoid unreachable
Branches.

**CASE / SELECT statements (pseudocode):**

```
CASE grade OF
    "A": PRINT "Excellent"
    "B": PRINT "Good"
    "C": PRINT "Satisfactory"
    OTHERWISE: PRINT "Below expectations"
ENDCASE
```

In Python, this can be simulated with `if/elif/else` or a dictionary:

```python
grade = "B"
messages = {
    "A": "Excellent",
    "B": "Good",
    "C": "Satisfactory"
}
print(messages.get(grade, "Below expectations"))
```

### 1.4 Iteration

**Count-controlled (FOR loop):**

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

`range(start, stop)` generates integers from `start` up to but **not including** `stop`. So
`range(1, 11)` gives 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

`range(n)` is shorthand for `range(0, n)`Giving 0, 1, ..., n-1.

`range(start, stop, step)` allows a custom step:

```python
for i in range(0, 20, 5):
    print(i)  # 0, 5, 10, 15
```

**Condition-controlled (WHILE loop):**

```python
total = 0
while total < 100:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    total = total + number
print("Total:", total)
```

**DO...UNTIL loop (pseudocode):**

A post-test loop that always executes at least once:

```
DO
    INPUT number
UNTIL number >= 1 AND number <= 10
```

Python has no built-in `DO...UNTIL`. The equivalent pattern is:

```python
while True:
    number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 10: "))
    if 1 <= number <= 10:
        break
```

**Nested loops:**

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, "x", j, "=", i * j)
```

The inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop. For nested loops with $n$ and
$m$ iterations, the total number of iterations is $n \times m$.

## 2. Data Structures

### 2.1 One-Dimensional Arrays

An **array** is a data structure that stores a fixed number of elements of the same data type,
Accessed by an index.

```python
scores = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]

# Accessing elements (0-indexed)
print(scores[0])  # 85
print(scores[3])  # 95

# Modifying elements
scores[2] = 80

# Finding the length
print(len(scores))  # 5

# Iterating over an array
for score in scores:
    print(score)

# Iterating with index
for i in range(len(scores)):
    print(f"Index {i}: {scores[i]}")
```

**Common array operations:**

```python
scores.append(76)       # Add to end
scores.insert(2, 90)    # Insert at index 2
scores.remove(78)       # Remove first occurrence of 78
popped = scores.pop()   # Remove and return last element
popped = scores.pop(0)  # Remove and return first element
index = scores.index(92)  # Find index of first occurrence
count = scores.count(85)  # Count occurrences
```

### 2.2 Two-Dimensional Arrays

A **2D array** is an array of arrays, representing a table or grid.

```python
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

print(grid[0][2])  # 3
print(grid[2][1])  # 8

# Iterating over a 2D array
for row in range(len(grid)):
    for col in range(len(grid[row])):
        print(grid[row][col], end=" ")
    print()
```

**Access pattern:** `grid[row][col]` -- the first index selects the row, the second selects the
Column. Think of a spreadsheet: you pick the row first, then the column.

**Practical example:** Representing a tic-tac-toe board:

```python
board = [
    ["X", "O", "X"],
    [" ", "X", "O"],
    ["O", " ", " "]
]

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print("|".join(row))
    print("-" * 5)

print_board(board)
```

### 2.3 Records

A **record** is a data structure that groups related data items of different types under a single
Name.

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 15,
    "form": "10B",
    "scores": [85, 92, 78]
}

print(student["name"])
student["age"] = 16
```

Records are useful because they group related data. Instead of having separate variables
`student_name``student_age``student_form`A record keeps them together logically.

## 3. Subprograms

### 3.1 Procedures and Functions

A **procedure** performs a task but does not return a value. A **function** performs a task and
Returns a value.

```python
# Procedure
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")

# Function
def calculate_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

room_area = calculate_area(5.5, 3.2)
print("Area:", room_area)
```

**Why use subprograms?**

- **Reusability:** Write once, call many times
- **Abstraction:** The caller does not need to know how the function works internally
- **Modularity:** Break a large program into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Testing:** Each function can be tested independently

### 3.2 Parameters and Arguments

**Parameters** are variables listed in the function definition. **Arguments** are the actual values
Passed when the function is called.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # a=5, b=3
```

**Parameters by value vs. By reference:**

- **By value:** A copy of the argument is passed; changes inside the function do not affect the
  original
- **By reference:** A reference to the original is passed; changes inside the function affect the
  original

In Python, immutable types (int, float, string, tuple) are passed by value. Mutable types (list,
Dict) are passed by reference.

```python
def modify_list(items):
    items.append(4)  # Modifies the original list

def modify_number(n):
    n = n + 1  # Does NOT modify the original

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

my_number = 10
modify_number(my_number)
print(my_number)  # 10
```

### 3.3 Local and Global Variables

```python
total = 0  # Global variable

def add_to_total(value):
    global total
    total = total + value  # Modifying the global variable

add_to_total(10)
print(total)  # 10
```

**Scope rules:** A variable created inside a function is **local** to that function and cannot be
Accessed from outside. A variable created outside any function is **global** and can be read by any
Function, but can only be modified with the `global` keyword.

**Best practice:** Use local variables wherever possible to avoid unintended side effects. Global
Variables make code harder to debug because any function can modify them.

### 3.4 Recursion

**Recursion** is when a function calls itself. Every recursive function must have a **base case**
(stopping condition) to prevent infinite recursion.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case

print(factorial(5))  # 120
```

**Trace:** factorial(5) = 5 _ factorial(4) = 5 _ 4 _ factorial(3) = 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ factorial(2) = 5

- 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ factorial(1) = 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1 _ factorial(0) = 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1 \* 1 = 120.

**The call stack.** Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. For `factorial(5)`The
Stack grows to 6 frames before the base case is reached. Then the frames are unwound as each call
Returns. If there is no base case, the stack grows until memory is exhausted, causing a
**StackOverflowError**.

**When to use recursion vs iteration:** Any recursive function can be rewritten as an iterative
Version (using a loop). Iteration is generally more memory-efficient because it does not add frames
To the call stack. Recursion is more natural for problems with a self-similar structure, such as
Tree traversal or divide-and-conquer algorithms.

## 4. String Manipulation

### 4.1 Common String Operations

```python
name = "Hello World"

print(len(name))         # 11 (length)
print(name[0])           # H (first character)
print(name[-1])          # d (last character)
print(name[0:5])         # Hello (substring from index 0 to 4)
print(name[6:])          # World (substring from index 6 to end)
print(name.upper())      # HELLO WORLD
print(name.lower())      # hello world
print(name.strip())      # removes leading and trailing whitespace
print(name.replace("World", "Python"))  # Hello Python
print(name.split(" "))   # ['Hello', 'World']
print(name.find("World"))  # 6 (index of first occurrence)
```

### 4.2 String Concatenation and Conversion

```python
first_name = "Alice"
last_name = "Smith"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

age = 15
message = "You are " + str(age) + " years old."
```

**f-strings** (formatted string literals) are preferred for readability:

```python
message = f"You are {age} years old."
```

### 4.3 String Validation

```python
# Check if input is numeric
password = input("Enter a number: ")
if password.isdigit():
    print("Valid number")
else:
    print("Not a number")

# Check length
if len(password) >= 8:
    print("Password is long enough")
```

### 4.4 String Traversal

```python
word = "Python"
for i in range(len(word)):
    print(word[i])

for char in word:
    print(char)
```

### 4.5 Palindrome Check (Higher Tier)

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

```python
def is_palindrome(word):
    word = word.lower()
    return word == word[::-1]

print(is_palindrome("Racecar"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("Hello"))    # False
```

The slice `word[::-1]` reverses the string. The `[::-1]` syntax means: start at the end, move
Backwards with a step of -1.

## 5. File Handling

### 5.1 Reading from a File

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()

# Reading line by line
file = open("data.txt", "r")
for line in file:
    print(line.strip())
file.close()
```

### 5.2 Writing to a File

```python
# Overwrite mode
file = open("output.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, World!\n")
file.write("Second line\n")
file.close()

# Append mode
file = open("output.txt", "a")
file.write("Third line\n")
file.close()
```

### 5.3 The `with` Statement

The `with` statement automatically closes the file, even if an exception occurs. This is the
Recommended approach.

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### 5.4 CSV Files

```python
import csv

with open("students.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row[0], row[1])

with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Score"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 92])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 78])
```

## 6. Validation and Verification

### 6.1 Validation

**Validation** checks that data is sensible and reasonable (but not necessarily correct).

| Type           | Check                               | Example                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Range check    | Value is within an acceptable range | Age between 0 and 120       |
| Type check     | Correct data type                   | Input is an integer         |
| Length check   | Correct number of characters        | Password is 8-20 characters |
| Presence check | Data has been entered               | Name field is not empty     |
| Format check   | Correct pattern (e.g. Email format) | Contains @ symbol           |

```python
def validate_age(age):
    try:
        age = int(age)
        if 0 <= age <= 120:
            return True
        else:
            print("Age must be between 0 and 120.")
            return False
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a whole number.")
        return False
```

**Comprehensive validation example:**

```python
def validate_password(password):
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False, "Password must be at least 8 characters."
    if not any(c.isupper() for c in password):
        return False, "Password must contain an uppercase letter."
    if not any(c.isdigit() for c in password):
        return False, "Password must contain a digit."
    return True, "Password is valid."

result, message = validate_password("Password123")
print(message)
```

### 6.2 Verification

**Verification** checks that data has been entered correctly (matches the source).

- **Double entry:** Data is entered twice and the two entries are compared
- **Visual check:** Data is checked by a person against the original source document

## 7. Robustness and Error Handling

### 7.1 Using Try/Except

```python
try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter numerator: "))
    denominator = int(input("Enter denominator: "))
    result = numerator / denominator
    print("Result:", result)
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter valid integers.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
```

**How try/except works:** Python attempts the code in the `try` block. If an error occurs, it
Immediately jumps to the matching `except` block. If no error occurs, the `except` block is skipped.

### 7.2 Defensive Programming

Writing code that anticipates and handles potential errors:

```python
def get_positive_integer(prompt):
    while True:
        try:
            value = int(input(prompt))
            if value > 0:
                return value
            else:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a whole number.")

age = get_positive_integer("Enter your age: ")
```

## 8. Random Number Generation

```python
import random

# Random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
dice = random.randint(1, 6)
print(f"You rolled: {dice}")

# Random float between 0 and 1
r = random.random()

# Random choice from a list
colours = ["red", "green", "blue"]
choice = random.choice(colours)

# Shuffle a list
deck = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(deck)
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Off-by-one errors with arrays.** Most languages use 0-based indexing; the last element is at
  index $n-1$. Accessing `array[n]` causes an `IndexError`.
- **Confusing = and ==.** A single `=` is assignment; `==` is comparison. Writing `if x = 5` in
  Python is a syntax error, but in some pseudocode contexts it can cause subtle bugs.
- **Forgetting to close files.** Always close files after use, or use a `with` statement. Leaving
  files open can cause data corruption or resource leaks.
- **Infinite loops.** Ensure the condition in a WHILE loop will eventually become false. If the loop
  variable never changes inside the loop body, the loop runs forever.
- **Not handling invalid input.** Always validate and handle potential errors in user input. A user
  might type "abc" when asked for their age.
- **Confusing local and global scope.** Use the `global` keyword only when necessary. Overusing
  global variables makes code hard to debug and test.
- **Integer division in Python 2 vs Python 3.** In Python 3, `5 / 2` gives `2.5`. In Python 2, it
  gives `2`. Use `//` for integer division in Python 3: `5 // 2` gives `2`.
- **String immutability.** Strings cannot be modified in place. Operations like `upper()` and
  `replace()` return new strings; they do not modify the original.

## Practice Questions

1. Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the average.

2. Write a program that reads 20 numbers from a file, sorts them using bubble sort, and writes the
   sorted list to another file.

3. Write a recursive function to calculate the $n$-th Fibonacci number.

4. Write a program that validates a password: at least 8 characters, contains at least one digit and
   one uppercase letter.

5. Write a function that takes a 2D array (3x3) and returns the sum of all elements in the main
   diagonal.

6. Write a program that uses a trace table to count the frequency of each character in a string.

7. Explain the difference between validation and verification, giving an example of each.

8. Write a program that reads student records from a CSV file and displays the names of students who
   scored above 80.

9. Write a function that takes a string and returns True if it is a palindrome (reads the same
   forwards and backwards).

10. Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for a number until they enter a valid positive
    integer, then displays the square root.

11. **(Higher Tier)** Write a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array containing
    elements that appear in both arrays (intersection).

12. **(Higher Tier)** Write a program that simulates a simple quiz. It should read questions and
    answers from a file, display each question, accept the user's answer, and keep score.

## Worked Examples

**Example 1:**

A typical exam question on Programming requires you to apply your knowledge to an unfamiliar
context. Read the question carefully, identify the key concept being tested, and structure your
answer using the appropriate terminology.

**Example 2:**

Multi-step problems in Programming often combine two or more concepts. Break the problem down:
identify what you need to find, recall the relevant formula or principle, substitute values, and
state your answer with correct units or formatting.

## Summary

This topic covers the core concepts of programming, including underlying theory, practical
implementation, and key applications.

**Key concepts include:**

- arrays and linked lists
- stacks and queues
- trees (binary, AVL, BST)
- hash tables
- graphs and their representations

Understanding these concepts thoroughly is essential for both examinations and practical
programming, and requires both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice.
