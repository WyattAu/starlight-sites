      'Which property of water allows it to act as a solvent for many ionic and polar substances?',
    options: ['Cohesion', 'Adhesion', 'High specific heat', 'Polarity'],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation:
      'Water’s polarity (unequal distribution of charge due to its bent molecular shape) allows it to form hydrogen bonds and dissolve ionic and polar substances. The partial negative oxygen attracts positive ions while the partial positive hydrogen attracts negative ions.',

    question: 'Carbon can form four covalent bonds because it has how many valence electrons?',
    options: ['2', '4', '6', '8'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Carbon has 4 valence electrons (electron configuration 1s&sup2; 2s&sup2; 2p&sup2;) and needs 4 more to complete its octet. This allows carbon to form 4 covalent bonds, making it the backbone of organic molecules and enabling the formation of diverse complex structures including chains, branched molecules, and rings.',

    options: ['Proteins', 'Carbohydrates', 'Nucleic acids', 'Phospholipids'],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation:
      'Phospholipids are the primary structural component of cell membranes. They have a hydrophilic phosphate head and hydrophobic fatty acid tails, forming a bilayer in aqueous environments. Proteins are embedded in or attached to this bilayer, but the membrane’s fundamental structure is the phospholipid bilayer.',

      'Primary and secondary only',
      'Primary, secondary, and tertiary',
      'All four levels',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      'Breaking peptide bonds destroys the primary structure (amino acid sequence). When the primary structure is destroyed, the secondary (alpha helices, beta sheets) and tertiary (overall 3D folding) structures also collapse because they depend on the intact chain. Quaternary structure may or may not be affected depending on whether the subunits are held together solely by peptide bonds or also by non-covalent interactions.',

    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      'Prokaryotic cells have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, which is absent from eukaryotic animal cells (though present in plants and fungi). Prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus and mitochondria. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have ribosomes, though prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller (70S vs 80S).',

      'Mitochondria',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is the primary site of lipid synthesis, including phospholipids and steroids. It also detoxifies drugs and stores calcium ions. The rough ER is studded with ribosomes and is involved in protein synthesis. The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages molecules.',

    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      'Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes that digest macromolecules, cellular waste, and engulfed pathogens. A high concentration of lysosomes indicates the cell is involved in phagocytosis or autophagy, such as macrophages or other cells that break down materials. This is characteristic of cells in the immune system or those undergoing programmed cell death.',

      'Chromosome movement during mitosis',
      'Transcription',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      'Microtubules form the mitotic spindle, which is responsible for separating chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. Destroying microtubules would prevent chromosome segregation, causing the cell cycle to arrest at metaphase. Microtubules are also involved in intracellular transport, cilia/flagella movement, and maintaining cell shape, but mitosis would be the most immediately affected.',

    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      'The energy of ATP is stored in the high-energy phosphate bonds (especially the bond between the second and third phosphates). Hydrolysing ATP to ADP + P_i releases about 7.3 kcal/mol under standard conditions. The adenine and ribose do not store significant usable energy.',

      'The Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle)',
      'The electron transport chain',
      'Oxidative phosphorylation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'CO\u2082 is produced during the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle) when pyruvate is fully oxidised. In the transition step, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, releasing one CO\u2082 per pyruvate. During the Krebs cycle itself, two more CO\u2082 molecules are released per acetyl-CoA. Glycolysis produces no CO\u2082; the electron transport chain produces water, not CO\u2082.',

    question: 'In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, what is the role of water?',
    options: [
      'It provides electrons to replace those lost by photosystem II',
      'It is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain',
      'It combines with CO\u2082 to form glucose',
      'It provides the energy to excite electrons in photosystem I',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      'Water is split during photolysis at photosystem II, releasing electrons, protons (H+), and O\u2082. The electrons replace those lost by the excited chlorophyll in PSII. This is why water is essential -- without it, the electron transport chain cannot continue. The final electron acceptor is NADP+ (forming NADPH), and CO\u2082 fixation occurs in the Calvin cycle, not the light reactions.',

      'Substrate-level phosphorylation',
      'ATP synthesis by ATP synthase',
      'Fermentation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      'ATP synthase uses the proton gradient (proton-motive force) across the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and P_i. Blocking this gradient stops chemiosmosis and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis and fermentation occur in the cytoplasm and do not depend on the mitochondrial proton gradient.',

    options: ['1:1', '3:1', '1:2:1', '9:3:3:1'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'A monohybrid cross between two heterozygotes (Aa &times; Aa) produces genotypes AA: Aa: aa in a 1:2:1 ratio. Assuming complete dominance, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (3 dominant phenotype : 1 recessive phenotype). The 1:2:1 is the genotypic ratio, not the phenotypic ratio.',

    options: ['1:1', '3:1', '1:2:1', '9:3:3:1'],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation:
      'Mendel’s law of independent assortment means that two genes on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome sort independently. A dihybrid cross (AaBb &times; AaBb) yields a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio: 9 showing both dominant traits, 3 showing dominant A and recessive b, 3 showing recessive a and dominant B, and 1 showing both recessive traits.',

      'During meiosis, crossing over between homologous chromosomes occurs during which stage?',
    options: ['Prophase I', 'Metaphase I', 'Prophase II', 'Telophase I'],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      'Crossing over (exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes) occurs during prophase I of meiosis. This process creates new combinations of alleles on individual chromosomes, contributing to genetic variation. It is one of the three key events that create genetic diversity in meiosis (along with independent assortment and random fertilisation).',

      'The data is inconclusive; more trials are needed',
      'The chi-square value proves the alternative hypothesis is true',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Since the chi-square value (7.82) exceeds the critical value (7.815), we reject the null hypothesis. This means the observed data deviates significantly from the expected ratio at the 0.05 significance level. There is less than 5% probability that this deviation occurred by chance alone, suggesting the observed ratios do not fit the predicted Mendelian ratios.',

    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      "Darwin’s natural selection requires: (1) variation in traits, (2) heritability of those traits, (3) differential survival/reproduction based on those traits, and (4) overproduction of offspring. Option C describes Lamarckian inheritance (acquired characteristics), which is not part of Darwin's theory of natural selection.",

    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'Allopatric speciation occurs when populations are geographically separated (by a physical barrier like a mountain range, river, or ocean), preventing gene flow. Over time, the isolated populations accumulate different mutations and experience different selective pressures, eventually becoming distinct species. Sympatric speciation occurs without geographic separation.',

      'Both homologous structures (shared anatomical features derived from a common ancestor, like the forelimbs of whales, bats, and humans) and vestigial structures (remnants of features that served a function in ancestors but are reduced in modern species, like the appendix or pelvic bones in whales) provide strong evidence for common ancestry. Analogous structures result from convergent evolution and do not indicate common ancestry.',
