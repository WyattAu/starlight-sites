    explanation:
      'Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features. Examples include using a function without knowing its internal code, or a map hiding geographic data at non-visible zoom levels. Decomposition (option A) is a separate concept involving breaking problems into smaller parts.',

    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      'An O(n) algorithm has running time proportional to n. If n doubles, the running time also approximately doubles. This is a linear relationship. For comparison, O(n&sup2;) would quadruple, O(1) would stay the same, and O(2&supn;) would increase exponentially.',

    explanation:
      'The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is responsible for fetching, decoding, and executing instructions.

    explanation:
      'RAM (Random Access Memory) provides fast, volatile (temporary) storage for data and instructions that the CPU is actively processing. It is cleared when power is removed. Long-term storage uses non-volatile media like hard drives or SSDs. BIOS is stored in firmware/ROM, not RAM.',

      'With 8 bits, there are 2&sup8; = 256 possible combinations (0 through 255). Each additional bit doubles the number of representable values. This is why 8-bit systems are limited to 256 distinct values in a single byte.',

    explanation:
      'Lossless compression (like ZIP, PNG, FLAC) is essential for text files because losing any data would corrupt the information. Lossy compression (like JPEG, MP3) achieves higher ratios by discarding data that humans cannot easily perceive, but is unsuitable for text where every character matters.',

      'The AVERAGE function computes the arithmetic mean of the specified range. =SUM(A1:A50)/COUNT(A1:A50) would also work, but =AVERAGE(A1:A50) is the direct built-in function. SUM gives the total, COUNT gives the number of values, and MEDIAN gives the middle value, not the average.',

    explanation:
      'In packet-switched networks (like the Internet), each packet is routed independently.
