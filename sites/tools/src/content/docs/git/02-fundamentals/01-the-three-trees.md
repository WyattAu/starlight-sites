## Overview

Git manipulates three distinct data structures, conventionally called **trees** (though "tree" is
overloaded in Git terminology — see [Git Objects](./02-git-objects.md)). These are:

1. **The Working Directory** (also called the **working tree**) — the actual files on disk.
2. **The Index** (also called the **staging area** or **cache**) — a binary file at `.git/index`
   that encodes a snapshot of what the _next_ commit will contain.
3. **The Repository** (the `.git/` directory) — the committed history, stored as a directed acyclic
   graph of objects.

Almost every Git command is a transformation between these three trees. Understanding this model
makes Git's behavior predictable, even for commands that appear confusing (like `git checkout`Which
can mean different things depending on context).

```mermaid

    [*] --> WorkingDirectory: git clone / git init
    WorkingDirectory --> Index: git add
    Index --> Repository: git commit
    Repository --> WorkingDirectory: git checkout
    Repository --> Index: git reset --soft
    Index --> WorkingDirectory: git restore --staged

    state WorkingDirectory {
        [*] --> WD: files on disk
    }

    state Index {
        [*] --> IDX: .git/index binary
    }

    state Repository {
        [*] --> REPO: .git/objects/
    }
```

## The Working Directory

The working directory is the directory on your filesystem where you edit files. It is a **checkout**
of a particular commit's tree — Git extracts the files referenced by a tree object and writes them
to disk.

### Key Properties

- **Mutable**: You can edit files freely. Git does not track changes until you explicitly stage
  them.
- **Possibly dirty**: The working directory can differ from both the index and the HEAD commit. The
  difference between the working directory and the index is what `git diff` shows by default.
- **Not versioned**: Deleting a file from the working directory does not delete it from Git history.
  It merely stages the deletion (if `git add` is run).

### Untracked vs Tracked Files

Git classifies files in the working directory into two categories:

| State         | Definition                                                                         | Shown by                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Tracked**   | File is in the index (either as a new addition or inherited from the last commit). | `git diff` (modified), `git status` (deleted) |
| **Untracked** | File is not in the index and not in `.gitignore`.                                  | `git status` (untracked files)                |

Files listed in `.gitignore` are **ignored** — they are not tracked and `git status` will not
mention them.

:::caution

`.gitignore` only affects **untracked** files. If a file is already tracked (committed), adding it
to `.gitignore` will have no effect. You must first untrack it with `git rm --cached <file>`.


## The Index

The index is perhaps the most misunderstood part of Git. It is **not** a diff or a list of changes —
it is a **complete snapshot** of the next commit's tree. When you run `git add file.txt`Git does not
record "file.txt was modified"; it computes the SHA-1 hash of the file's current content, creates
(or reuses) a blob object in `.git/objects/`And updates the index to point to that blob.

### Internal Structure

The index is stored as a binary file at `.git/index`. Its structure (version 4, as of Git 2.x)
contains:

| Section    | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header     | Signature (`DIRC`), version (2, 3, or 4), number of entries |
| Entries    | Sorted list of `(pathname, stat info, SHA-1, stage)` tuples |
| Extensions | Optional: tree cache, untracked cache, conflict markers     |
| Checksum   | SHA-1 of all preceding content                              |

Each entry contains:

- **Pathname**: Relative to the repository root (e.g., `src/main.c`).
- **Stat information**: File mode (regular file, symlink, executable), size, mtime. Used by Git to
  skip `stat()` calls during `git status` (the "racy git" problem).
- **SHA-1**: The hash of the blob object this entry points to.
- **Stage**: Used during merge conflicts (stage 1 = base, stage 2 = ours, stage 3 = theirs).

### Why a Separate Staging Area?

The staging area is a deliberate design decision that enables several workflows:

1. **Atomic commits**: You can stage specific hunks of a file (`git add -p`), creating commits that
   contain logically related changes rather than "everything I changed today."
2. **Review before commit**: `git diff --cached` shows exactly what will be committed, allowing you
   to verify the snapshot before recording it permanently.
3. **Merge machinery**: The three-way merge algorithm operates on three trees — the base commit,
   "ours," and "theirs." The index holds the merge result before it is committed.

:::
:::tip

If you find the staging area cumbersome, you can bypass it entirely with `git commit -a` (stages all
tracked modified files) or `git commit --amend --no-edit` (adds all staged changes to the previous
commit). Some developers prefer `git add -A && git commit` as a single workflow step.


## The Repository

The repository is the `.git/` directory (or a bare repository, which _is_ the `.git/` directory). It
contains:

- **The object store** (`.git/objects/`): All blobs, trees, commits, and tags, identified by their
  SHA-1 hashes.
- **References** (`.git/refs/`): Named pointers to commits — branches, tags, HEAD.
- **Configuration** (`.git/config`): Repository-local settings.
- **Various metadata**: `description``info/exclude``hooks/`Etc.

The repository is the **authoritative source of truth** for the project's history. The working
directory and index are derived from it; they are caches that can be reconstructed at any time.

## State Transitions

Every common Git command can be understood as a transformation between the three trees. This table
is the most important reference in this guide:

| Command                       | From → To                                     | Effect                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git init`                    | — → Repository + Working Directory            | Creates empty repository and working directory                                |
| `git clone`                   | Remote → Repository → Working Directory       | Copies remote repository and checks out default branch                        |
| `git add <file>`              | Working Directory → Index                     | Computes blob hash, updates index entry                                       |
| `git add -p <file>`           | Working Directory → Index (partial)           | Stages selected hunks only                                                    |
| `git rm <file>`               | Working Directory + Index → —                 | Removes from index and working directory                                      |
| `git rm --cached <file>`      | Index → —                                     | Removes from index only (file remains on disk)                                |
| `git commit`                  | Index → Repository                            | Creates commit object pointing to current index tree                          |
| `git status`                  | Reads all three                               | Shows differences between the trees                                           |
| `git diff`                    | Working Directory vs Index                    | Shows unstaged changes                                                        |
| `git diff --cached`           | Index vs HEAD commit                          | Shows staged changes                                                          |
| `git diff HEAD`               | Working Directory vs HEAD                     | Shows all changes (staged + unstaged)                                         |
| `git checkout <branch>`       | Repository → Working Directory + Index        | Updates both to match target commit                                           |
| `git restore <file>`          | Index → Working Directory                     | Discards working directory changes                                            |
| `git restore --staged <file>` | HEAD → Index                                  | Unstages file (reverts index to HEAD version)                                 |
| `git reset HEAD <file>`       | HEAD → Index                                  | Same as `git restore --staged`                                                |
| `git reset --soft HEAD~1`     | HEAD → Repository (move)                      | Moves branch pointer back; index and working directory unchanged              |
| `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`    | HEAD → Repository + Index                     | Moves branch pointer back and resets index                                    |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1`     | HEAD → Repository + Index + Working Directory | **Destructive**: moves branch back, resets index and discards working changes |
| `git stash`                   | Working Directory + Index → Stash stack       | Temporarily saves changes; resets to HEAD                                     |
| `git stash pop`               | Stash stack → Working Directory + Index       | Restores most recent stash                                                    |
| `git merge <branch>`          | Repository + Working Directory + Index        | Three-way merge into current branch                                           |

### Visualizing `git reset` Variants

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Before reset"
        A1["HEAD"]
        B1["Index"]
        C1["Working Directory"]
    end

    subgraph "--soft"
        A2["HEAD moves back"]
        B2["Index unchanged"]
        C2["Working Dir unchanged"]
    end

    subgraph "--mixed (default)"
        A3["HEAD moves back"]
        B3["Index matches HEAD"]
        C3["Working Dir unchanged"]
    end

    subgraph "--hard"
        A4["HEAD moves back"]
        B4["Index matches HEAD"]
        C4["Working Dir matches HEAD"]
    end

    A1 -.-> A2
    B1 -.-> B2
    C1 -.-> C2

    A1 -.-> A3
    B1 -.-> B3
    C1 -.-> C3

    A1 -.-> A4
    B1 -.-> B4
    C1 -.-> C4
```

:::
:::caution

`git reset --hard` is **destructive** — it discards all uncommitted changes. Before using it, verify
with `git status` and `git stash` if you want to preserve your work.


## The "Dirty" State Space

The relationship between the three trees defines the repository's state:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Clean States"
        C1["All three trees identical\n(git status: nothing to commit)"]
    end

    subgraph "Dirty States"
        D1["Working Dir ≠ Index\n(git diff shows changes)"]
        D2["Index ≠ HEAD\n(git diff --cached shows changes)"]
        D3["Both dirty\n(modified and staged changes)"]
        D4["Merge conflict\n(Index has unmerged entries)"]
    end

    C1 --> D1
    C1 --> D2
    D1 --> D3
    D2 --> D3
    D3 --> D4
```

Understanding these states is critical for using Git safely:

- **Clean**: `git status` reports "nothing to commit, working tree clean." Safe to switch branches,
  pull, or rebase.
- **D1 only**: You have edited files but not staged them. `git checkout` or `git restore` will
  discard changes. `git stash` will save them.
- **D2 only**: You have staged files but the working directory matches the index. Safe to commit.
  Switching branches will carry staged changes.
- **D3**: Both staged and unstaged changes exist. Be careful with `git checkout` — it only affects
  the working directory, not the index.
- **D4**: A merge conflict. The index has entries in multiple stages. You must resolve conflicts
  (editing files) and `git add` them to mark resolution before committing.

## The Porcelain vs Plumbing Distinction

Git commands are divided into two categories:

| Category      | Purpose                   | Examples                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Porcelain** | User-facing, high-level   | `git add``git commit``git checkout``git merge`                       |
| **Plumbing**  | Low-level building blocks | `git hash-object``git update-index``git write-tree``git commit-tree` |

The three-tree model is implemented entirely by plumbing commands. `git add file.txt` is equivalent
to:

```bash
# Compute SHA-1 hash of the file and store it as a blob object
BLOB=$(git hash-object -w file.txt)

# Update the index entry for file.txt to point to this blob
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644,$BLOB,file.txt
```

And `git commit -m "message"` is roughly:

```bash
# Write the current index as a tree object
TREE=$(git write-tree)

# Create a commit object with the tree, parent, and message
COMMIT=$(git commit-tree $TREE -p HEAD -m "message")

# Update the current branch to point to the new commit
git update-ref refs/heads/main $COMMIT
```

:::
:::info

Understanding plumbing commands is not necessary for daily use, but it demystifies Git's behavior
and enables scripting. When a porcelain command does something unexpected, breaking it down into
plumbing steps reveals exactly what happened.


## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing authentication (who you are) with authorisation (what you can do) in security contexts.

2. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).

3. Writing pseudocode that is too language-specific rather than using standard algorithmic
   constructs.

4. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.
