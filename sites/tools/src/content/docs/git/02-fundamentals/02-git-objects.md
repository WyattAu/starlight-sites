## Intuition

**A library of immutable snapshots:** Git objects are like a library of sealed time capsules — each commit, file, and directory is stored as an immutable object identified by its content hash. Nothing is ever truly deleted; old versions remain accessible through the object graph.

**Why it matters:** Understanding Git objects explains why `git checkout` is instant (it just moves a pointer), why `git rebase` rewrites history (it creates new objects), and why `.git` can grow large (old objects accumulate).

**The key insight:** Git stores snapshots, not diffs — each commit points to a complete tree of files. Diffs are computed on demand, not stored. This makes operations like checkout and branch switching O(1) regardless of history size.

## The Content-Addressable Filesystem

At its core, Git is a **content-addressable filesystem**. It stores data as objects, each identified
by the SHA-1 hash of its content. This is not a version control feature — it is the fundamental
storage mechanism. Version control is built on top of it.

There are four types of Git objects:

| Type       | Purpose           | Contains                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **blob**   | File content      | Raw file bytes (no filename, no metadata)                              |
| **tree**   | Directory listing | List of `(mode, name, SHA-1)` entries (blobs or subtrees)              |
| **commit** | Snapshot metadata | Tree SHA-1, parent commit(s), author, committer, message, timestamp    |
| **tag**    | Annotated tag     | Tag name, tagger, message, target commit SHA-1, optional GPG signature |

Every object is stored as a compressed file under `.git/objects/`Named by its SHA-1 hash. For
example, an object with hash `a3f2b1c...` is stored at `.git/objects/a3/f2b1c...`.

## Blobs

A blob is the simplest Git object. It stores the **raw content** of a file — nothing more. It does
not store the filename, permissions, or any metadata. Two files with identical content at different
paths produce the same blob object.

### Creating a Blob

```bash
## Create a blob from a file"s content and print its hash
$ echo "Hello, World" | git hash-object -w --stdin
ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a

## Verify the object exists
$ git cat-file -t ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a
blob

# Print the blob's content
$ git cat-file -p ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a
Hello, World
```

### Blob Identity

The hash is computed over the concatenation of the object header and the content:

```
blob <content-length>\0<content>
```

For `"Hello, World\n"` (13 bytes):

```
blob 13\0Hello, World
```

The SHA-1 of this byte sequence is `ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a`.

:::note
`echo -n "Hello, World"` produces `Hello, World` (12 bytes). These produce different blob hashes.
This is a common source of confusion when scripting Git operations.

### Deduplication

Because blob identity is based purely on content, Git automatically deduplicates identical files
across commits and directories:

```bash
# Two files with identical content
$ echo "same content" > a.txt
$ echo "same content" > b.txt

$ git hash-object a.txt
$ git hash-object b.txt
# Both produce the same hash: 7f1bfd55bd05ed5e4e1e8e6f91f639f9700c4c4b

# Only one blob object is stored in .git/objects/
```

This is why Git is efficient at storing projects with many similar files (e.g., renamed files,
copied configurations) — identical content is stored exactly once.

## Trees

A tree object represents a **directory listing**. Each entry in a tree is a triple:

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **mode**  | File type and permissions (e.g., `100644` = regular file, `100755` = executable, `040000` = directory, `120000` = symlink) |
| **name**  | Filename or directory name                                                                                                 |
| **SHA-1** | Hash of the blob (for files) or subtree (for directories)                                                                  |

### Tree Structure

Consider this directory:

```
project/
├── README.md
└── src/
    ├── main.c
    └── utils.c
```

Git stores this as two tree objects:

```
Root tree:
  100644 blob <hash-readme>  README.md
  040000 tree <hash-src>     src

src/ subtree:
  100644 blob <hash-main>    main.c
  100644 blob <hash-utils>   utils.c
```

### Inspecting Trees

```bash
# Show the tree object for the current commit
$ git cat-file -p HEAD^{tree}
100644 blob a3f2b1c...    README.md
040000 tree b7e9d4f...    src

# Show the src/ subtree
$ git cat-file -p HEAD:src
100644 blob c1d2e3f...    main.c
100644 blob d4e5f6a...    utils.c
```

### Tree Hashing

Like blobs, trees are hashed with a header:

```
tree <content-length>\0<entries>
```

Each entry is encoded as `<mode> <name>\0<20-byte-sha1>` (binary SHA-1, not hex). The entries are
**sorted** lexicographically by name, which is critical for canonical hashing — the same directory
must always produce the same tree hash.
:::
:::caution
means `src` sorts as `src/`Which places it before `src-file` but after `src0`. This detail matters
if you are manually constructing tree objects.

## Commits

A commit object is a **snapshot of the project at a point in time**, plus metadata. It contains:

| Field         | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **tree**      | SHA-1 of the root tree object (the directory listing)                                                                |
| **parent(s)** | SHA-1 of the parent commit(s). Zero parents = initial commit. Multiple parents = merge commit                        |
| **author**    | Name, email, timestamp of the person who wrote the changes                                                           |
| **committer** | Name, email, timestamp of the person who created the commit (may differ from author during `git rebase` or `git am`) |
| **message**   | Commit message (includes optional trailers like `Co-authored-by:`)                                                   |

### Commit Structure

```bash
$ git cat-file -p HEAD
tree a3f2b1c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6
parent b7e9d4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1
author Wyatt <wyatt@example.com> 1717300000 +0800
committer Wyatt <wyatt@example.com> 1717300000 +0800

```

### The Commit DAG

Commits form a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG). Each commit points to its parent(s), creating a
chain of history. A merge commit has two or more parents, creating a diamond-shaped topology.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B"
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit id: "C"
    commit id: "D"
    checkout main
    commit id: "E"
    merge feature id: "F"
    commit id: "G"
```

In this graph:

- `A` is the **root commit** (no parent).
- `B` and `E` are **linear commits** (one parent each).
- `F` is a **merge commit** (parents: `E` and `D`).
- `main` points to `G``feature` points to `D`.

### Author vs Committer

The distinction between author and committer is important in workflows where commits are rewritten:

| Scenario                 | Author             | Committer          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Normal commit            | Original developer | Original developer |
| `git rebase`             | Original developer | Person who rebased |
| `git am` (apply mailbox) | Patch sender       | Person who applied |
| `git commit --amend`     | Original developer | Person who amended |

This separation preserves attribution while allowing history to be rewritten. `git log` shows both
fields.

### Reachability and the Object Graph

An object is **reachable** if there exists a path from at least one reference (branch, tag, HEAD,
stash, reflog entry) to that object. Unreachable objects are candidates for garbage collection (see
[Packing and Garbage Collection](../06-internals/02-packing-and-garbage-collection.md)).

```bash
# Show all objects reachable from HEAD
$ git rev-list --objects HEAD

# Show unreachable objects
$ git fsck --unreachable
```

## Tags

Git supports two types of tags:

### Lightweight Tags

A lightweight tag is a **reference** pointing to a commit. It is stored as a file in
`.git/refs/tags/` containing the commit SHA-1. No additional metadata is stored.

```bash
$ git tag v1.0
# Creates .git/refs/tags/v1.0 containing a commit SHA-1
```

### Annotated Tags

An annotated tag is a **full Git object** (type `tag`) that contains:

- The tag name
- The tagger (name, email, timestamp)
- A message
- The SHA-1 of the target commit (or other object)
- An optional GPG signature

```bash
$ git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"

# Inspect the tag object
$ git cat-file -p v1.0
object a3f2b1c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6
type commit
tag v1.0
tagger Wyatt <wyatt@example.com> 1717300000 +0800

Release version 1.0
```

### When to Use Which

| Use lightweight    | Use annotated                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Private bookmarks  | Public releases                       |
| Temporary pointers | Signed releases (GPG)                 |
| Personal workflow  | Semantic versioning milestones        |
|                    | When you need metadata (date, tagger) |
:::
:::tip
or message, which makes them unsuitable for audit trails. Use `git tag -a` or configure
`tag.forceSignAnnotated` for GPG signing.

## Object Storage Format

### Loose Objects

Newly created objects are stored as individual **loose objects** — compressed (zlib deflate) files
under `.git/objects/`. The filename is the first 2 characters of the SHA-1 hash, and the file
contains the remaining 38 characters as a suffix:

```
.git/objects/
├── a3/
│   └── f2b1c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6  (zlib-compressed)
├── b7/
│   └── e9d4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1
└── ...
```

### Packfiles

When the number of loose objects exceeds a threshold (configurable via `gc.auto`Default 6700), Git
packs them into a **packfile** (`.git/objects/pack/pack-<hash>.pack`) with delta compression. See
[Packing and Garbage Collection](../06-internals/02-packing-and-garbage-collection.md) for details.

## Practical Implications

### Content-Addressable Caching

The content-addressable nature of Git objects enables powerful workflows:

```bash
# Check if a file's content has been seen before
$ git hash-object file.txt
# If this hash matches an existing blob, the content is already in the object store

# Find all commits that contain a specific file content
$ git log --all --find-object=<blob-hash>
```

### Integrity Verification

```bash
# Verify the integrity of the entire object database
$ git fsck --full

# This checks:
# 1. Every referenced object exists
# 2. Every object's hash matches its content
# 3. The commit graph is acyclic
# 4. Tree entries point to valid objects
```

### Hash Length Disambiguation

Git allows using a **prefix** of the SHA-1 hash as long as it is unambiguous within the repository:

```bash
# Full hash: a3f2b1c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6
# Can be abbreviated to the shortest unambiguous prefix
$ git log a3f2b1c  # Works if no other object starts with a3f2b1c
```

The minimum safe prefix length depends on the number of objects in the repository. For a project
with $N$ objects, you need approximately $\lceil \log_{16} N \rceil$ hex characters. Git will warn
you if a prefix is ambiguous:

```
warning: ambiguous argument 'a3f2': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing `git reset` and `git revert`. Reset moves the branch pointer; revert creates a new
   commit that undoes changes.

2. Forgetting to pull before pushing when working collaboratively, leading to merge conflicts.

3. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).

4. Misunderstanding the difference between a stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO) in data structure
   applications.

5. Writing pseudocode that is too language-specific rather than using standard algorithmic
   constructs.

6. Confusing authentication (who you are) with authorisation (what you can do) in security contexts.
