## Intuition

Git's distributed architecture means every clone is a complete repository with full history, and remotes are directly pointers to other repositories. Push uploads your commits to a remote, fetch downloads new commits without merging, and pull combines fetch with merge. The distinction between bare repositories (server-side, no working directory) and non-bare repositories (developer workstations) explains why you cannot push to a non-bare repo by default. Understanding these operations is fundamental to collaborative development workflows.

## Distributed Architecture

Git's distributed architecture means there is no intrinsic client-server relationship. Any
repository can act as a "remote" for any other. In practice, one repository is designated as the
"canonical" or "origin" repository, and all others sync with it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Developer A"
        A1["Local repo<br/>(.git/)"]
    end

    subgraph "Remote (origin)"
        R["Bare repo<br/>(no working directory)"]
    end

    subgraph "Developer B"
        B1["Local repo<br/>(.git/)"]
    end

    subgraph "CI/CD"
        C1["Runner<br/>(clone + build)"]
    end

    A1 -- "git push" --> R
    R -- "git fetch" --> A1
    B1 -- "git push" --> R
    R -- "git fetch" --> B1
    R -- "git clone" --> C1

### Bare vs Non-Bare Repositories

| Type                   | Working Directory | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Non-bare** (default) | Yes               | Developer workstation — edit, commit, push    |
| **Bare** (`--bare`)    | No                | Server-side repository — receives pushes only |

A bare repository is just the `.git/` directory without a working tree. It is the standard format
for remote servers (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea):

```bash
## Create a bare repository
$ git init --bare project.git

## Clone from a bare repository
$ git clone user@server:/path/to/project.git
```

:::note
remote's branch pointer, but the remote's working directory and index will not be updated, causing
inconsistencies. If you need a server-side repo with a working tree, use a **post-receive hook** to
check out the files.

## Configuring Remotes

### Adding Remotes

```bash
# Add a remote named "origin" (conventional name for the primary remote)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Add a secondary remote
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/org/repo.git

# Add with a custom fetch refspec
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Managing Remotes

```bash
# List all remotes
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/org/repo.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/org/repo.git (push)

# Show details for a specific remote
$ git remote show origin

# Rename a remote
$ git remote rename old-name new-name

# Remove a remote
$ git remote remove upstream

# Change a remote's URL
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
```

### URLs: HTTPS vs SSH

| Protocol  | URL Format                         | Authentication   | Use Case                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTPS** | `https://github.com/user/repo.git` | Token / password | Public repos, CI/CD, firewalled environments |
| **SSH**   | `git@github.com:user/repo.git`     | SSH key          | Frequent pushes, personal development        |
:::
:::tip
to inject tokens as environment variables). GitHub recommends HTTPS for all new repositories.

## Fetch

`git fetch` downloads objects and references from a remote repository **without modifying your
working directory or branches**. It updates your remote-tracking branches (e.g., `origin/main`) but
does not merge anything.

```bash
# Fetch all remotes and all branches
$ git fetch --all

# Fetch from a specific remote
$ git fetch origin

# Fetch a specific branch
$ git fetch origin main

# Fetch and prune deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --prune
# Equivalent to: git fetch --all && git remote prune origin
```

### What Fetch Does

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Local as Local Repo
    participant Remote as Remote (origin)

    Local->>Remote: git fetch origin
    Remote->>Local: Send new objects (commits, trees, blobs)
    Remote->>Local: Update refs/remotes/origin/*
    Note over Local: Working directory UNCHANGED<br/>Local branches UNCHANGED
```

After fetching, you can inspect the differences:

```bash
# See what commits are on origin/main that you don't have
$ git log HEAD..origin/main

# See what commits you have that origin/main doesn't
$ git log origin/main..HEAD

# See all differences (both directions)
$ git log HEAD...origin/main
```

## Pull

`git pull` is a shorthand for `git fetch` followed by `git merge` (or `git rebase`):

```bash
# Default: fetch + merge
$ git pull origin main

# Fetch + rebase (recommended for clean history)
$ git pull --rebase origin main

# Configure rebase as default pull behavior
$ git config --global pull.rebase true
```

### Why `--rebase` is Better

Without `--rebase``git pull` creates a merge commit for every pull, cluttering the history:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id: "B"
    checkout main
    commit id: "C (your local work)"
    merge origin/main id: "D (merge commit from pull)"
    commit id: "E (more local work)"
    merge origin/main id: "F (another merge commit from pull)"
```

With `--rebase`Your local commits are replayed on top of the remote, maintaining a linear history:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    checkout origin/main
    commit id: "B"
    checkout main
    commit id: "C'"
    commit id: "E'"
```
:::
:::caution
those commits to a shared branch. If you have, see the
[Golden Rule of Rebasing](../03-branching-and-merging/03-rebasing.md#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing).

## Push

`git push` uploads local commits to a remote repository and updates the remote's branch pointer.

```bash
# Push current branch to its tracking remote
$ git push

# Push a specific branch to a specific remote
$ git push origin feature-auth

# Push and set up tracking
$ git push -u origin feature-auth

# Push all branches
$ git push --all origin

# Push all tags
$ git push --tags
```

### Push Safety

By default, Git refuses to push a non-fast-forward update:

```
error: failed to push some refs to 'origin'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: "git pull ...'') before pushing again.
```

This prevents overwriting commits that other developers may have based their work on.

### Force Push

Force pushing overwrites the remote branch with your local branch, discarding any commits on the
remote that are not in your local history:

```bash
# Force push (DANGEROUS)
$ git push --force origin feature-auth

# Safer force push: only if the remote is a fast-forward of your branch
$ git push --force-with-lease origin feature-auth
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Before force-with-lease"
        R1["origin/feature: A → B → C"]
        L1["local/feature: A → B → D"]
    end

    subgraph "git push --force-with-lease"
        C1{"origin/feature still<br/>at C (unchanged since fetch)?"}
        C1 -->|Yes| C2["Force push succeeds"]
        C1 -->|No| C3["Push rejected<br/>(someone else pushed to C)"]
    end

    subgraph "git push --force"
        D1["Always overwrites remote<br/>(NO SAFETY CHECK)"]
    end

    style C3 fill:#ffcdd2
    style D1 fill:#ffcdd2
```
:::
:::caution
- **`--force-with-lease`**: Only overwrites if the remote has not changed since your last fetch.
  **Always prefer this over `--force`.**

Never force push `main` or any shared branch. The consequences are:

1. Other developers" histories diverge from the remote.
2. Their next `git push` will be rejected.
3. They must `git pull --rebase` or reset their branches, potentially losing their own unpushed
   commits.

## Clone

`git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository:

```bash
# Standard clone
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Clone into a specific directory
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git my-project

# Shallow clone (only the latest commit, no history)
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Clone a specific branch
$ git clone --branch feature-auth https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Sparse clone (only specific directories)
$ git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/user/repo.git
$ cd repo
$ git sparse-checkout set src/docs
```

### What Clone Creates

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
mkdir repo && cd repo
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
git fetch origin
git checkout -b main origin/main  # or whatever the default branch is
```

The clone creates:

| Component              | Description                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `.git/`                | Full local repository with all objects and refs |
| Working directory      | Checkout of the default branch                  |
| `origin` remote        | Points to the source URL                        |
| `main` tracking branch | Tracks `origin/main`                            |

### Clone Variants

| Variant     | Command               | Use Case                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Full**    | `git clone`           | Development — full history, all branches       |
| **Shallow** | `git clone --depth=1` | CI/CD — only latest commit, minimal disk usage |
| **Sparse**  | `git clone --sparse`  | Monorepos — only specific directories          |
| **Mirror**  | `git clone --mirror`  | Backup/migration — all refs, bare repository   |
| **Bare**    | `git clone --bare`    | Server setup — no working directory            |

## Remote-Tracking Branches

Remote-tracking branches (e.g., `origin/main`) are local references that represent the state of a
remote branch as of the last `git fetch`. They are updated automatically by `fetch` and `pull`But
**never by local commits**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["origin/main<br/>(remote-tracking ref)"] -->|"git fetch"| B["Updated to match<br/>remote's main"]
    C["main<br/>(local branch)"] -->|"git commit"| D["Moves forward<br/>independently"]
    A -->|"git merge origin/main"| C
    D -->|"git push"| E["Remote's main updated"]

    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style C fill:#e8f5e9
```

```bash
# Difference between local and remote
$ git log HEAD..origin/main    # Commits on remote that you don't have
$ git log origin/main..HEAD    # Commits you have that remote doesn't

# Fetch without merging
$ git fetch origin

# Merge remote changes
$ git merge origin/main

# Or: fetch + rebase in one step
$ git pull --rebase origin main
```

## Practical Workflows

### Fork-Based Workflow (Open Source)

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
$ git clone https://github.com/you/repo.git
$ cd repo

# 3. Add the upstream repository
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/org/repo.git

# 4. Create a feature branch
$ git switch -c feature-auth main

# 5. Keep up-to-date with upstream
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/main

# 6. Push to your fork
$ git push origin feature-auth

# 7. Create a pull request from your fork to the upstream repo
```

### Shared Repository Workflow (Team)

```bash
# 1. Clone the shared repository
$ git clone git@github.com:org/repo.git
$ cd repo

# 2. Create a feature branch
$ git switch -c feature-auth

# 3. Commit and push frequently
$ git commit -m "WIP: auth module"
$ git push -u origin feature-auth

# 4. Create a pull request
# 5. After review and approval, merge via the PR interface
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.

2. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).

3. Misunderstanding the difference between a stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO) in data structure
   applications.

4. Forgetting that $O(n \log n)$ average-case for quicksort becomes $O(n^2)$ worst-case on already
   sorted input.
