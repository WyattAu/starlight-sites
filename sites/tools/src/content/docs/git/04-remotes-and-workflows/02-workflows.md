## Choosing a Branching Strategy

A branching strategy defines **when to create branches, how long they live, how they integrate, and
Who can modify which branches**. There is no universal "best" strategy — the right choice depends on
Team size, release cadence, deployment model, and risk tolerance.

This guide covers the most widely-used strategies, their trade-offs, and when to use each.

## Trunk-Based Development

### Concept

All developers commit to a single shared branch ( `main`). Feature branches are extremely
Short-lived (hours, not days). Integration is continuous — every commit is potentially deployable.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B (dev 1)"
    commit id: "C (dev 2)"
    commit id: "D (dev 1)"
    commit id: "E (dev 3)"
    commit id: "F (CI/CD deploys every commit)"
```

### Rules

1. **No long-lived branches** — feature branches exist for at most a few hours.
2. **Continuous integration** — every commit triggers automated tests.
3. **Feature flags** — incomplete features are hidden behind configuration toggles.
4. **Small batches** — commits should be small and independently reviewable.
5. **Pre-merge validation** — automated tests must pass before merging.

### Advantages

| Advantage               | Explanation                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No merge hell**       | No large, complex merges — changes are integrated incrementally |
| **Fast feedback**       | CI runs on every commit, catching issues immediately            |
| **Easy rollback**       | `git revert <hash>` undoes a single commit                      |
| **Simplified workflow** | No branch management overhead                                   |

### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage                    | Mitigation                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Requires robust CI/CD           | Invest in automated testing before adopting |
| Feature flags add complexity    | Use a feature flag management system        |
| Large teams may have contention | Use short-lived feature branches (< 1 day)  |
| Requires disciplined commits    | Commit frequently, keep commits atomic      |

### When to Use

- Teams with strong CI/CD pipelines
- Continuous deployment environments
- Small to medium teams (up to $\sim$15 developers)
- SaaS products with frequent releases

:::info

Google, Meta, and many other large tech companies use trunk-based development internally. It scales
Well with proper tooling (Bazel for builds, automated canary deployments).


## GitHub Flow

### Concept

A simplified version of trunk-based development with one long-lived branch (`main`) and short-lived
Feature branches. Every change requires a pull request.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B"
    branch feature-auth
    checkout feature-auth
    commit id: "C"
    commit id: "D"
    checkout main
    commit id: "E"
    checkout feature-auth
    merge main id: "F (merge)"
    checkout main
    merge feature-auth id: "G (merge commit)"
    commit id: "H"
```

### Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`: `git switch -c feature-auth`
2. Make commits and push: `git push -u origin feature-auth`
3. Open a pull request
4. Discuss, review, and iterate
5. Merge into `main` (with `--no-ff`)
6. Deploy `main`

### Rules

1. `main` is always deployable.
2. All changes go through pull requests.
3. PRs should be small (ideally < 400 lines changed).
4. Tests must pass before merging.
5. Deploy `main` after every merge (or on a schedule).

### When to Use

- Open-source projects
- Teams without formal release cycles
- Projects with continuous deployment
- Any team using GitHub

## Git Flow

### Concept

A structured branching model with two long-lived branches (`main` and `develop`) and several
Short-lived branch types. Originally published by Vincent Driessen in 2010.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Long-lived branches"
        MAIN["main\n(production-ready)"]
        DEV["develop\n(integration)"]
    end

    subgraph "Short-lived branches"
        F["feature/*\n(new features)"]
        R["release/*\n(release prep)"]
        H["hotfix/*\n(urgent fixes)"]
    end

    MAIN ---|"merge (no-ff)"| DEV
    DEV ---|"branch"| F
    F ---|"merge (no-ff)"| DEV
    DEV ---|"branch"| R
    R ---|"merge (no-ff)"| MAIN
    R ---|"merge (no-ff)"| DEV
    MAIN ---|"branch"| H
    H ---|"merge (no-ff)"| MAIN
    H ---|"merge (no-ff)"| DEV

    style MAIN fill:#ffcdd2
    style DEV fill:#e8f5e9
    style F fill:#e3f2fd
    style R fill:#fff3e0
    style H fill:#f3e5f5
```

### Branch Types

| Branch      | Purpose                 | Lifetime  | Created From | Merges Into        |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| `main`      | Production releases     | Permanent | —            | —                  |
| `develop`   | Integration branch      | Permanent | `main`       | —                  |
| `feature/*` | Feature development     | Short     | `develop`    | `develop`          |
| `release/*` | Release preparation     | Short     | `develop`    | `main` + `develop` |
| `hotfix/*`  | Urgent production fixes | Short     | `main`       | `main` + `develop` |

### Workflow

```bash
# Start a feature
$ git switch -c feature/login develop
# ... work ...
$ git switch develop
$ git merge --no-ff feature/login
$ git branch -d feature/login

# Start a release
$ git switch -c release/1.0 develop
# ... bump versions, fix bugs, update docs ...
$ git switch main
$ git merge --no-ff release/1.0
$ git tag -a v1.0
$ git switch develop
$ git merge --no-ff release/1.0
$ git branch -d release/1.0

# Start a hotfix
$ git switch -c hotfix/fix-crash main
# ... fix the bug ...
$ git switch main
$ git merge --no-ff hotfix/fix-crash
$ git tag -a v1.0.1
$ git switch develop
$ git merge --no-ff hotfix/fix-crash
$ git branch -d hotfix/fix-crash
```

### Advantages

| Advantage                | Explanation                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clear separation**     | Features, releases, and hotfixes have distinct branches    |
| **Parallel development** | Multiple features can be developed simultaneously          |
| **Release isolation**    | Release branches allow bug fixes without blocking features |
| **Well-documented**      | Widely understood, many tools support it natively          |

### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage            | Explanation                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complex**             | 5 branch types, strict merge rules — high cognitive overhead                 |
| **Merge-heavy**         | Every feature requires a merge commit into `develop`Then another into `main` |
| **Slow feedback**       | Features can live in isolation for weeks, accumulating conflicts             |
| **Not ideal for CI/CD** | The `develop` branch creates an unnecessary integration step                 |

### When to Use

- Projects with scheduled releases (e.g., monthly, quarterly)
- Teams that need to support multiple production versions simultaneously
- Projects where releases require significant preparation (version bumps, changelogs, release notes)
- Regulated environments where release audit trails are required

:::
:::caution

Git Flow is often overused. For most modern software projects, GitHub Flow or trunk-based
Development is simpler and more effective. Only adopt Git Flow if you genuinely need release
Branches and hotfix workflows.


## Forking Workflow

### Concept

Each developer has their own fork (personal copy) of the canonical repository. Changes flow from
Fork → pull request → canonical repository.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Developer A"
        FA["fork/user-a/repo"]
    end

    subgraph "Developer B"
        FB["fork/user-b/repo"]
    end

    subgraph "Canonical"
        UP["org/repo"]
    end

    FA -- "PR" --> UP
    FB -- "PR" --> UP
    UP -- "git fetch" --> FA
    UP -- "git fetch" --> FB
```

### When to Use

- Open-source projects (contributors don"t have write access)
- External contractors
- Organizations where write access is restricted

## Comparison Matrix

| Criterion               | Trunk-Based   | GitHub Flow          | Git Flow                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Complexity**          | Low           | Low                  | High                        |
| **Branch count**        | 1 + ephemeral | 1 + short-lived      | 2 + multiple types          |
| **Merge frequency**     | Continuous    | Per PR               | Per feature/release         |
| **CI/CD requirement**   | Mandatory     | Strongly recommended | Recommended                 |
| **Release model**       | Continuous    | On-demand            | Scheduled                   |
| **Hotfix handling**     | `git revert`  | Branch from `main`   | Dedicated `hotfix/*` branch |
| **History cleanliness** | Linear        | Mostly linear        | Complex merge graph         |
| **Team size**           | Small–medium  | Any                  | Any                         |
| **Learning curve**      | Low           | Low                  | Moderate                    |

## Commit Message Conventions

Regardless of branching strategy, consistent commit messages are essential. The most widely-used
Convention is **Conventional Commits**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

| Type       | Purpose                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New feature                                |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                      |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace (no code change)    |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                    |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                   |
| `chore`    | Build process, dependencies, tooling       |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes                |

Examples:

```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh

Implement automatic token refresh when the access token expires.
Uses a refresh token stored in an HTTP-only cookie.

Closes #42.

fix(parser): handle empty input without crashing

The parser would segfault on empty input because it dereferenced
a null pointer after strtok returned NULL. Added a null check.

BREAKING CHANGE: The parser now returns an error instead of silently
accepting empty input. Update callers to handle ParseError.
```

:::
:::tip

Configure `commitlint` with `@commitlint/config-conventional` to enforce commit message conventions
In CI:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
echo "export default { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };" > commitlint.config.js
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing authentication (who you are) with authorisation (what you can do) in security contexts.

2. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.

3. Forgetting that $O(n \log n)$ average-case for quicksort becomes $O(n^2)$ worst-case on already
   sorted input.

4. Forgetting edge cases in algorithm design (e.g., empty input, single element, already sorted
   data).
