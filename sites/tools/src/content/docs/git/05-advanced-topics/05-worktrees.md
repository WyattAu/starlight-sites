## What are Worktrees

`git worktree` allows you to have **multiple working directories** from the same repository, each
checked out to a different branch. Unlike `git stash` (which temporarily shelves changes) or
switching branches (which requires a clean working directory), worktrees let you work on multiple
branches simultaneously.

### The Problem Worktrees Solve

Without worktrees, switching branches requires a clean working directory:

```bash
$ git switch feature-auth
# "error: Your local changes would be overwritten"
$ git stash
$ git switch feature-auth
# ... work on feature ...
$ git switch main
$ git stash pop
# ... work on main ...
```

With worktrees, both branches are available simultaneously:

```bash
$ git worktree add ../repo-auth feature-auth
$ cd ../repo-auth
# ... work on feature-auth ...
$ cd ../repo-main
# ... work on main simultaneously ...
```

## How Worktrees Work Internally

A worktree is a linked working directory that shares the same `.git` object database and refs as the
main repository:

```
repo/                          # Main worktree
├── .git/                      # Full .git directory (object store, refs, etc.)
├── src/
│   └── main.c
└── README.md

repo-auth/                     # Linked worktree
├── .git                       # FILE (not directory!) containing path to main repo
├── src/
│   └── auth.c
└── README.md
```

The `.git` file in the linked worktree contains:

```
gitdir: /path/to/repo/.git/worktrees/repo-auth
```

And the main repository records the worktree:

```
repo/.git/
├── worktrees/
│   └── repo-auth/
│       ├── HEAD
│       ├── index
│       ├── commondir
│       └── gitdir
└── ...
```

Each worktree has its own:

- **HEAD** (pointing to its branch)
- **Index** (staging area)
- **Working directory**

But they share:

- **Object store** (`.git/objects/`)
- **References** (branches, tags)
- **Configuration**

```mermaid

    subgraph "Shared"
        OBJ["Object Store<br/>(.git/objects/)"]
        REF["References<br/>(.git/refs/)"]
        CFG["Configuration<br/>(.git/config)"]
    end

    subgraph "Main Worktree (repo/)"
        W1_HEAD["HEAD → main"]
        W1_IDX["Index"]
        W1_WD["Working Directory<br/>(main branch)"]
    end

    subgraph "Linked Worktree (repo-auth/)"
        W2_HEAD["HEAD → feature-auth"]
        W2_IDX["Index"]
        W2_WD["Working Directory<br/>(feature-auth branch)"]
    end

    W1_HEAD --> REF
    W2_HEAD --> REF
    W1_IDX --> OBJ
    W2_IDX --> OBJ
    W1_WD --> W1_IDX
    W2_WD --> W2_IDX

    style OBJ fill:#e8f5e9
    style REF fill:#e8f5e9
```

## Creating Worktrees

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create a worktree for an existing branch
$ git worktree add ../repo-auth feature-auth

# Create a worktree and a new branch simultaneously
$ git worktree add -b feature-auth ../repo-auth main

# Create a worktree at a specific commit (detached HEAD)
$ git worktree add ../repo-debug a3f2b1c

# Create a worktree for a new branch from a specific commit
$ git worktree add -b hotfix-crash ../repo-hotfix a3f2b1c
```

### Listing Worktrees

```bash
$ git worktree list
/path/to/repo          abc1234 [main]
/path/to/repo-auth     def5678 [feature-auth]
```

### Removing Worktrees

```bash
# Remove a worktree (deletes the working directory)
$ git worktree remove ../repo-auth

# Force remove (even if there are uncommitted changes)
$ git worktree remove --force ../repo-auth

# Prune stale worktree entries (if the directory was deleted manually)
$ git worktree prune
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Parallel Development

Work on a hotfix while in the middle of a feature:

```bash
$ git worktree add ../repo-hotfix -b hotfix-crash main
$ cd ../repo-hotfix
# Fix the crash, test, commit, push
$ cd ../repo-main
# Continue working on your feature — no stash needed
```

### 2. Side-by-Side Code Review

```bash
$ git worktree add ../repo-review origin/feature-auth
# Open both repos in your IDE
# Diff side-by-side between ../repo-main and ../repo-review
```

### 3. Long-Running Tests

```bash
$ git worktree add ../repo-test main
$ cd ../repo-test
# Run a 30-minute test suite on main
# Meanwhile, continue developing in ../repo-main
```

### 4. Build and Test Different Versions

```bash
$ git worktree add ../repo-v1 v1.0
$ git worktree add ../repo-v2 v2.0
# Build and test both versions simultaneously
```

## Limitations

### No Duplicate Branches

Each branch can only be checked out in **one** worktree at a time:

```bash
$ git worktree add ../repo-auth main
# Error: "main' is already checked out at '/path/to/repo'
```

### Bare Repositories

A bare repository (no working directory) cannot have a main worktree. All worktrees are linked:

```bash
$ git init --bare project.git
$ git worktree add project-main main
```

### Submodule Interaction

Submodules in worktrees can be tricky — each worktree initializes submodules independently, which
can lead to conflicts:

```bash
# In each worktree, initialize submodules separately
$ cd ../repo-auth
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Worktree vs Stash vs Branch

| Feature           | Worktree               | Stash                | Branch            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Parallel work     | Yes                    | No                   | No (must switch)  |
| Persistent        | Yes (until removed)    | Until popped/dropped | Yes               |
| Independent index | Yes                    | No (single index)    | No (single index) |
| Disk usage        | Higher (full checkout) | Minimal              | Minimal           |
| Setup cost        | `git worktree add`     | `git stash push`     | `git switch`      |

**Rule of thumb**: Use worktrees when you need to work on two things simultaneously for more than a
few minutes. Use stash for brief interruptions. Use branches for sequential work.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Neglecting to normalise database designs, leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.

2. Confusing authentication (who you are) with authorisation (what you can do) in security contexts.

3. Forgetting that $O(n \log n)$ average-case for quicksort becomes $O(n^2)$ worst-case on already
   sorted input.

4. Mixing up Big O, Big $\Omega$, and Big $\Theta$ notation. Big O is an upper bound, not
   necessarily tight.

## Intuition

Worktrees are like having multiple desks in the same office. Instead of clearing your desk to work on a different project (stash/switch), you simply walk to another desk that already has the other project set up. Both desks share the same filing cabinet (object database) but have their own workspace. This is like having multiple browser tabs open - you can switch between them instantly without losing your place. The key insight is that worktrees eliminate context-switching overhead. You can run tests on the main branch while developing a feature on another branch, without stashing or committing incomplete work.
