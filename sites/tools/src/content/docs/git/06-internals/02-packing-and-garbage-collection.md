## The Object Lifecycle

Git objects go through three phases:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Loose Object<br/>(newly created)"] --> B["Packed Object<br/>(compressed in packfile)"]
    B --> C["Unreachable Object<br/>(no ref points to it)"]
    C --> D["Pruned Object<br/>(deleted by gc)"]

    style A fill:#e8f5e9
    style B fill:#e3f2fd
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#ffcdd2
```

### 1. Loose Objects

When you run `git add` or `git commit`Git creates objects as individual zlib-compressed files under
`.git/objects/`. These are called **loose objects**.

**Performance characteristics**:

- Creation: $O(1)$ — just write a file.
- Lookup: $O(\log n)$ — filesystem directory lookup (first 2 hex chars) + file read.
- Storage: Each object is compressed independently. No delta compression between objects.
- Overhead: Each file consumes a filesystem inode and a disk block (minimum 4 KB, even for small
  objects).

For small repositories (few hundred objects), loose objects are fine. For large repositories
(millions of objects), the overhead becomes significant.

### 2. Packed Objects

When the number of loose objects exceeds `gc.auto` (default: 6700), Git automatically packs them
into a **packfile**. You can also trigger packing manually:

```bash
# Pack all loose objects
$ git gc

# Pack aggressively (slower but better compression)
$ git gc --aggressive
```

#### Packfile Format

A packfile (`.git/objects/pack/pack-<hash>.pack`) contains:

| Section | Description                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header  | Magic bytes (`PACK`), version (2), number of objects        |
| Objects | Compressed objects (delta-compressed against other objects) |
| Trailer | SHA-1 checksum of all preceding content                     |

#### Delta Compression

Packfiles use **delta compression** to store similar objects efficiently. Instead of storing each
object in full, Git stores one base object and then stores subsequent objects as deltas (differences
from the base):

```
Base object: commit A (full content, 200 bytes)
Delta 1: commit B → "change author email" (20 bytes)
Delta 2: commit C → "change commit message" (15 bytes)
```

For the Linux kernel repository, delta compression reduces the packfile size by approximately
$10\times$ compared to loose objects.

#### Delta Chain Depth

Delta objects can themselves be delta-compressed against other delta objects, forming a **delta
chain**:

```
commit A (base)
  └── commit B (delta of A)
        └── commit C (delta of B)
              └── commit D (delta of C)
```

Deep delta chains (depth > 50) degrade performance because Git must decompress the entire chain to
access the final object. `git gc` limits delta depth to `pack.depth` (default: 50).

#### The Index File

Each packfile has a corresponding `.idx` (index) file that enables $O(1)$ lookup of objects by SHA-1
hash. The index is a sorted binary table:

| Offset | SHA-1      | CRC32     |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- |
| 0      | a3f2b1c... | 0x8a7f... |
| 234    | b7e9d4f... | 0x3c2d... |
| 567    | c1d2e3f... | 0x9e1b... |

### 3. Unreachable and Pruned Objects

An object is **unreachable** if no reference (branch, tag, HEAD, reflog, stash) points to it —
directly or transitively (through a tree or commit chain).

```bash
# Find unreachable objects
$ git fsck --unreachable

# Prune unreachable objects older than 2 weeks (default)
$ git gc

# Prune ALL unreachable objects immediately
$ git gc --prune=now
```

<aside class="starlight-aside starlight-aside--caution">
Always verify with `git fsck --unreachable` first, and ensure you don"t need the objects (e.g.,
they're not needed for a reflog-based recovery).

## Garbage Collection

`git gc` performs several maintenance tasks:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["git gc"] --> B["Pack loose objects"]
    A --> C["Repack packfiles<br/>(consolidate small packs)"]
    A --> D["Prune unreachable objects"]
    A --> E["Expire reflog entries"]
    A --> F["Remove stale working tree files"]

    style A fill:#e3f2fd
```

### gc Configuration

| Setting               | Default       | Meaning                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `gc.auto`             | 6700          | Number of loose objects that triggers auto-gc |
| `gc.autoPackLimit`    | 50            | Number of packfiles that triggers auto-repack |
| `gc.pruneExpire`      | `2.weeks.ago` | Age threshold for pruning unreachable objects |
| `gc.reflogExpire`     | `90.days.ago` | Age threshold for expiring reflog entries     |
| `gc.aggressiveWindow` | 250           | Window size for aggressive delta compression  |
| `gc.pack.depth`       | 50            | Maximum delta chain depth                     |

### When GC Runs Automatically

Git runs auto-gc in certain operations (`git commit``git merge``git rebase`) when the loose object
count exceeds `gc.auto`. You can disable auto-gc:

```bash
$ git config gc.auto 0
```

### Aggressive GC

`git gc --aggressive` uses more CPU and memory to achieve better compression:

- Larger delta window (250 objects instead of 10).
- Deeper delta chains (up to 250 instead of 50).
- Recompresses all objects (not just loose ones).

Use `--aggressive` for repositories that are archived or infrequently updated. For active
repositories, the overhead is not worth the marginal compression improvement.

## Maintenance

### `git maintenance`

Git 2.31+ includes a built-in maintenance system:

```bash
# Register for background maintenance (cron/systemd)
$ git maintenance start

# Run maintenance now
$ git maintenance run

# Run specific tasks
$ git maintenance run --task=loose-objects
$ git maintenance run --task=pack-refs
$ git maintenance run --task=gc
```

### Recommended Maintenance Schedule

| Task            | Frequency                 | Command                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Loose objects   | Daily (auto)              | `git gc` (auto-triggered) |
| Reflog expiry   | 90 days                   | `git reflog expire --all` |
| Full GC         | Monthly                   | `git gc --aggressive`     |
| Integrity check | After suspicious behavior | `git fsck --full`         |

## Performance Implications

### Large Repositories

For repositories with millions of objects (Linux kernel, Chromium, Android), packfile management is
critical:

- **Pack too large**: Slower clone times, higher memory usage.
- **Too many packs**: Slower object lookup (Git checks each pack's index).
- **Fragmentation**: Frequent commits to many files create many small packs.

### Optimization Strategies

```bash
# Repack with a single large packfile
$ git repack -a -d

# Use bitmap index for faster clone/fetch
$ git repack -a -d --write-bitmap-index

# Prune old packs after repacking
$ git prune-packed
```

The **bitmap index** is a Bloom-filter-like structure that enables $O(1)$ reachability queries,
significantly speeding up `git clone``git fetch`And `git gc` on large repositories.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Confusing DNA replication (S phase) with transcription or translation. Be clear about which
   process is being described.

2. Failing to link structure to function when describing biological molecules, cells, or organs.

3. Confusing correlation with causation when evaluating experimental data and drawing conclusions.

4. Misinterpreting graphs by confusing the independent and dependent variables or reading scales
   incorrectly.

## Intuition

Packing is like compressing a photo album. Loose objects are like individual photos scattered in a drawer - easy to add but take up space. Packfiles are like putting all photos in an album with shared pages - similar photos share the same background, saving space. Delta compression is like storing only the differences between similar photos instead of full copies. Garbage collection is like cleaning out the attic - it removes photos that nobody is looking at anymore (unreachable objects) and organizes the rest. The key insight is that Git balances speed (loose objects for quick writes) with efficiency (packed objects for storage), automatically transitioning between the two as needed.
