## SHA-1: The Original Hash

Since its creation, Git has used **SHA-1** (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) to identify all objects. Every
Blob, tree, commit, and tag is named by the 40-character hexadecimal representation of its SHA-1
Hash, producing a $2^{160}$ address space.

### SHA-1 Properties

| Property             | Value                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Output size          | 160 bits (20 bytes, 40 hex characters)      |
| Collision resistance | $2^{80}$ (theoretical) — broken in practice |
| Preimage resistance  | $2^{160}$ (unbroken)                        |
| Speed                | Fast (hardware-accelerated on modern CPUs)  |

### The SHA-1 Collision Problem

In 2017, researchers at Google and CWI Amsterdam demonstrated the first **SHA-1 collision** (the
"SHAttered" attack). They produced two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash, requiring
Approximately $2^{63.1}$ computations (far below the theoretical $2^{80}$).

**Does this affect Git?** Directly, not much. The attack required significant computational
Resources ($\sim$6,500 CPU-years) and was specifically crafted for PDF files. However, it proved
That SHA-1"s collision resistance is weaker than assumed, and future advances could make attacks
Cheaper.

### Git's Defenses Against Collision Attacks

Git has several properties that make collision attacks harder than generic SHA-1 collisions:

1. **Object headers**: Git hashes `"<type> <size>\0<content>"`Not raw content. An attacker must
   collide the full header+content.
2. **Detect checks**: `git fsck` detects objects whose hash does not match their content.
3. **Collision detection**: Git includes collision detection code that detects SHAttered-style
   attacks.

## SHA-256: The Transition

Git 2.29 (September 2020) added experimental support for **SHA-256** as an alternative hash
Algorithm.

### Enabling SHA-256

```bash
## Initialize a new repository with SHA-256
$ git init --object-format=sha256

## Configure globally for new repositories
$ git config --global init.defaultObjectFormat sha256

# Check the hash algorithm of an existing repository (0=SHA-1, 1=SHA-256)
$ git config core.repositoryFormatVersion
```

### SHA-256 Properties

| Property             | SHA-1              | SHA-256                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Output size          | 160 bits           | 256 bits                    |
| Collision resistance | $2^{80}$ (broken)  | $2^{128}$ (secure)          |
| Preimage resistance  | $2^{160}$ (secure) | $2^{256}$ (secure)          |
| Hash length          | 40 hex chars       | 64 hex chars                |
| Speed                | Faster             | $\sim$20% slower (software) |

### Migration Challenges

Migrating an existing repository from SHA-1 to SHA-256 is **not currently supported** by Git. This
Is because:

1. **Every object hash changes**: All blobs, trees, commits, and tags get new hashes.
2. **All references break**: Branches, tags, remotes. Everything must be updated.
3. **All packfiles must be regenerated**: The entire object store is invalidated.
4. **Interoperability**: SHA-256 repositories cannot interoperate with SHA-1 tools or servers.

The Git community is working on a migration path, but it is not yet production-ready. For new
Repositories, enabling SHA-256 from the start is recommended.

## Hash Length Abbreviation

Git allows abbreviating hashes to the shortest unambiguous prefix:

```bash
# Full SHA-1 (40 chars)
a3f2b1c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6

# Abbreviated (minimum unambiguous length)
a3f2b1c

# Configure minimum abbreviation length
$ git config core.abbrev 12  # Require at least 12 chars
```

With SHA-256, the minimum abbreviation length is longer (more objects can share a prefix before
Diverging). Git handles this automatically.

## Practical Implications

### For New Projects

```bash
# Start new projects with SHA-256
$ git init --object-format=sha256
```

This provides future-proofing at essentially zero cost (the slight speed difference is negligible
For most workflows).

### For Existing Projects

No migration path exists yet. Monitor the Git mailing list for updates. In the meantime:

- Run `git fsck` periodically to detect corruption.
- Keep your `gc.pruneExpire` settings generous to avoid accidental data loss.
- Back up your `.git` directory regularly.

### For Security-Sensitive Projects

If you are concerned about collision attacks:

1. Enable **fsck**: Run `git fsck` in CI to detect corrupted objects.
2. Sign commits: Use GPG or SSH to sign commits and tags.
3. Use SHA-256 for new repositories.

## Content-Addressable Storage: Design Rationale

Git's choice of content-addressable storage (CAS) is fundamental to its design. The implications are
Far-reaching:

| Property                  | Benefit                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deduplication**         | Identical files across commits produce one blob object                        |
| **Integrity**             | Any modification of an object changes its hash, breaking references           |
| **Distributed consensus** | Two developers can independently verify they have the same object             |
| **Deterministic builds**  | A commit hash uniquely identifies a project state                             |
| **Garbage collection**    | Unreachable objects can be safely deleted without affecting reachable objects |

The trade-off is that Git cannot efficiently store files that change slightly and frequently (e.g.,
Large binary files, databases). This is why Git LFS exists — it stores the large file content
Outside the object store and tracks only a pointer.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Writing vague answers without specific biological terminology. Use precise terms (e.g.,
   'phospholipid bilayer' not 'membrane').

2. Using anecdotal evidence or small sample sizes as though they constitute robust scientific data.

3. Failing to link structure to function when describing biological molecules, cells, or organs.

4. Misinterpreting graphs by confusing the independent and dependent variables or reading scales
   incorrectly.

## Intuition

Hashing is like a fingerprint for data. Just as a fingerprint uniquely identifies a person, a hash uniquely identifies a piece of content. Content-addressable storage is like a library where books are shelved by their ISBN number instead of by title or author - if two books have the same ISBN, they must be the same book. SHA-1 produces a 40-character hex string that acts as this ISBN. The key insight is that hashing provides integrity verification - if even one bit of a file changes, its hash changes completely. This is like a tamper-evident seal on a package - any attempt to open it leaves evidence. Git uses this to ensure that every object in the repository is exactly what it claims to be.
