## 1. Network Models

### 1.1 OSI Model (7 Layers)

| Layer | Name         | Function                          | Examples                   |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | User interface, application logic | HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP       |
| 6     | Presentation | Data formatting, encryption       | TLS/SSL, JPEG, ASCII       |
| 5     | Session      | Dialog control, synchronization   | NetBIOS, RPC               |
| 4     | Transport    | End-to-end reliability            | TCP, UDP                   |
| 3     | Network      | Routing, logical addressing       | IP, ICMP, OSPF, BGP        |
| 2     | Data Link    | Framing, error detection          | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP       |
| 1     | Physical     | Bit transmission over medium      | Cables, fiber, radio waves |

### 1.2 TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)

| TCP/IP Layer   | OSI Layers | Protocols                 |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Application    | 5, 6, 7    | HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP, TLS |
| Transport      | 4          | TCP, UDP                  |
| Internet       | 3          | IP, ICMP, ARP             |
| Network Access | 1, 2       | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC      |

### 1.3 Encapsulation

Each layer adds a header (and sometimes trailer) to the data from the layer above:

```
Application data
→ [TCP header | Application data]
→ [IP header | TCP header | Application data]
→ [Ethernet header | IP header | TCP header | Application data | FCS]
```

## 2. Physical Layer

### 2.1 Signals and Encoding

**Analog signals:** Continuous, represented by sine waves. Parameters: amplitude, frequency, phase.

**Digital signals:** Discrete (0s and 1s). Encoded as voltage levels.

**Encoding schemes:**

| Scheme                  | Description                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| NRZ-L                   | High = 0, Low = 1 (or vice versa)                          |
| NRZ-I                   | Transition at 1, no transition at 0                        |
| Manchester              | Transition at midpoint: low→high = 1, high→low = 0         |
| Differential Manchester | Transition at start of each bit; no mid-bit transition = 1 |
| 4B/5B                   | 4 data bits encoded as 5 bits (80% efficiency)             |

### 2.2 Bandwidth and Data Rate

**Nyquist theorem** (noiseless channel):

$$C = 2B \log_2 V$$

where $B$ = bandwidth (Hz), $V$ = signal levels.

**Shannon's theorem** (noisy channel):

$$C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})$$

where SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (power ratio). If $\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}} = 30$, then
$\text{SNR} = 10^{30/10} = 1000$.

### 2.3 Multiplexing

**FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing):** Divide bandwidth into frequency bands, each carrying a
separate signal.

**TDM (Time-Division Multiplexing):** Divide time into slots, each carrying data from a different
source.

**WDM (Wavelength-Division Multiplexing):** FDM over fiber optics using different wavelengths
(colors) of light.

**Statistical TDM:** Dynamically allocate time slots based on demand (more efficient than
synchronous TDM).

### 2.4 Transmission Media

| Medium        | Bandwidth      | Distance    | Use              |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Twisted pair  | Up to 1 Gbps   | Up to 100m  | LAN (Cat 5e/6/7) |
| Coaxial cable | Up to 10 Gbps  | Up to 500m  | Cable TV         |
| Fiber optic   | Up to 100 Tbps | Up to 100km | Backbone, WAN    |
| Radio (Wi-Fi) | Up to 9.6 Gbps | Up to 100m  | WLAN             |

## 3. Data Link Layer

### 3.1 Framing

Divide the bit stream into **frames** for transmission.

**Framing methods:**

- **Byte count:** First byte specifies frame length (vulnerable to count corruption).
- **Byte stuffing (flag bytes):** Use special delimiter DLE STX/DLE ETX; escape DLE within data.
- **Bit stuffing:** Flag pattern 01111110; after five consecutive 1s, insert a 0.

```
BIT_STUFF(data):
    result = ""
    count = 0
    for each bit in data:
        if bit == 1:
            count += 1
            if count == 5:
                result += "10"  // stuff a 0
                count = 0
                continue
        else:
            count = 0
        result += bit
    return result
```

### 3.2 Error Detection

**Parity check:** Add 1 bit so total 1s is even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). Detects
single-bit errors.

**Checksum:** Sum all 16-bit words, take 1's complement. Used in TCP, UDP, IP.

**CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):**

Given message $M(x)$ and generator polynomial $G(x)$:

1. Append $r$ zero bits to $M(x)$ where $r = \deg(G(x))$.
2. Divide by $G(x)$ using polynomial (mod 2) division.
3. Remainder $R(x)$ is the CRC.
4. Transmit $M(x) \cdot x^r + R(x)$.
5. Receiver divides by $G(x)$; zero remainder = no error.

**Detection capability:** Detects all single-bit errors, all double-bit errors, all odd-number
errors, and any burst of length $\leq r$.

### 3.3 Error Correction

**Hamming code:** Adds parity bits at positions $2^i$ to correct single-bit errors.

For $m$ data bits, use $r$ parity bits where $2^r \geq m + r + 1$.

| Data bits | Parity bits | Total |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 4         | 3           | 7     |
| 8         | 4           | 12    |
| 16        | 5           | 21    |

### 3.4 MAC Protocols

**ALOHA:** Transmit anytime. If collision, wait random time and retransmit. Throughput:
$\sim 18.4\%$.

**Slotted ALOHA:** Time divided into slots. Transmit only at slot boundaries. Throughput:
$\sim 36.8\%$.

**CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection):**

1. Sense channel: idle → transmit; busy → wait.
2. While transmitting, detect collisions.
3. On collision: send jam signal, wait (binary exponential backoff), retry.

$$\text{Backoff time} = \text{rand}(0, 2^k - 1) \times \text{slot time}$$

where $k = \min(\text{retries}, 10)$. Used in Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).

**CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance):** Used in Wi-Fi (802.11). Uses RTS/CTS handshake to reserve the
channel before transmitting.

```
CSMA_CA(sender, receiver):
    // Wait for channel idle for DIFS
    while channel busy: wait
    wait DIFS
    send RTS
    wait CTS
    wait SIFS
    send data
    wait ACK after SIFS
```

## 4. Network Layer

### 4.1 IP Addressing

**IPv4 address:** 32 bits, written as 4 octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

**IPv6 address:** 128 bits, written as 8 groups of 4 hex digits (e.g.,
2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).

**IPv4 address classes:**

| Class | Range                       | Default Subnet | Max Hosts    |
| ----- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| A     | 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255   | /8             | $2^{24} - 2$ |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 | /16            | $2^{16} - 2$ |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 | /24            | $2^8 - 2$    |
| D     | 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 | Multicast      |
| E     | 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 | Reserved       |

### 4.2 Subnetting and CIDR

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Notation $a.b.c.d/n$ where $n$ = number of network bits.

**Subnet mask:** $n$ 1-bits followed by $32-n$ 0-bits.

**Number of subnets:** $2^{\text{subnet bits}}$

**Hosts per subnet:** $2^{32-n} - 2$ (subtract network address and broadcast address).

**Example:** 192.168.1.0/26 → 64 addresses, 62 usable hosts, 4 subnets.

**Subnetting algorithm:**

```
SUBNET(network, prefix_length, num_subnets):
    subnet_bits = ceil(log2(num_subnets))
    new_prefix = prefix_length + subnet_bits
    subnet_size = 2^(32 - new_prefix)
    for i = 0 to num_subnets - 1:
        start = network + i * subnet_size
        print f"{start}/{new_prefix}"
```

### 4.3 NAT (Network Address Translation)

Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address for Internet access:

$$\text{Private: } (10.0.0.0/8, \ 172.16.0.0/12, \ 192.168.0.0/16)$$

**NAT types:**

- **Static NAT:** One-to-one mapping.
- **Dynamic NAT:** Pool of public IPs, assigned on demand.
- **PAT (NAT overload):** Maps multiple private IPs to one public IP using port numbers.

### 4.4 Routing Protocols

**RIP (Routing Information Protocol):**

- Distance-vector protocol. Uses **Bellman-Ford** algorithm.
- Metric: **hop count** (max 15 hops).
- Sends entire routing table every 30 seconds.
- Convergence: Slow. Count-to-infinity problem.

```
RIP_UPDATE(router):
    every 30 seconds:
        for each destination d:
            min_cost = INF
            next_hop = NIL
            for each neighbor n:
                if cost(d, n) + 1 < min_cost:
                    min_cost = cost(d, n) + 1
                    next_hop = n
            update routing table for d
```

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):**

- Link-state protocol. Uses **Dijkstra's** algorithm.
- Each router has a complete map of the network topology.
- Floods LSA (Link State Advertisements) on topology changes.
- Fast convergence. Supports areas for scalability.

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):**

- Path-vector protocol. Used for **inter-AS (autonomous system)** routing.
- Exchanges reachability information between ASes.
- Policy-based routing (economic, political considerations).
- **eBGP** (between ASes) and **iBGP** (within an AS).

| Protocol | Type            | Algorithm    | Metric        | Scope    | Convergence |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| RIP      | Distance-vector | Bellman-Ford | Hop count     | AS       | Slow        |
| OSPF     | Link-state      | Dijkstra     | Cost (custom) | Area/AS  | Fast        |
| BGP      | Path-vector     | Policy-based | AS path       | Internet | Varies      |

## 5. Transport Layer

### 5.1 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- **Connectionless:** No handshake, no connection state.
- **Unreliable:** No acknowledgment, no retransmission.
- **No ordering:** Packets may arrive out of order.
- **No congestion control.**
- **Header:** 8 bytes (src port, dst port, length, checksum).
- **Use cases:** DNS, DHCP, real-time streaming, gaming.

### 5.2 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- **Connection-oriented:** Three-way handshake.
- **Reliable:** Acknowledgments, retransmissions, sequence numbers.
- **Ordered:** Sequences guarantee in-order delivery.
- **Byte-stream:** No message boundaries.
- **Flow controlled:** Receiver controls sender's rate.
- **Congestion controlled:** Sender adjusts to network conditions.

**TCP header:** 20 bytes minimum (src port, dst port, seq number, ack number, flags, window,
checksum, urgent pointer, options).

### 5.3 TCP Three-Way Handshake

```
Client                              Server
  |--- SYN (seq=x) ------------------>|
  |<-- SYN+ACK (seq=y, ack=x+1) -----|
  |--- ACK (seq=x+1, ack=y+1) ------>|
  |                                  |
  |          CONNECTION ESTABLISHED   |
```

### 5.4 TCP Reliable Delivery

**Sequence numbers:** Each byte is numbered. SYN and FIN consume one sequence number.

**Acknowledgments:** Cumulative; ACK $n$ means all bytes up to $n-1$ received.

**Retransmission:** On timeout (RTO = estimated RTT + 4 \* RTT deviation):

$$\text{EstimatedRTT} = (1-\alpha) \cdot \text{EstimatedRTT} + \alpha \cdot \text{SampleRTT}$$

$$\text{DevRTT} = (1-\beta) \cdot \text{DevRTT} + \beta \cdot |\text{SampleRTT} - \text{EstimatedRTT}|$$

In most cases $\alpha = 0.125$, $\beta = 0.25$.

**Fast retransmit:** 3 duplicate ACKs trigger immediate retransmission without waiting for timeout.

### 5.5 TCP Flow Control

**Sliding window:** Receiver advertises available buffer space via the window field.

```
Sender maintains:
    send_base: oldest un-ACKed byte
    next_seq_num: next byte to send

Receiver maintains:
    recv_base: next expected byte
    window: advertised window size
```

- **Zero window probe:** When window is 0, sender sends probes to detect when window opens.
- **Silly Window Syndrome:** Avoided by Nagle's algorithm (sender buffers small segments) and
  Clark's solution (receiver doesn't advertise small windows).

### 5.6 TCP Congestion Control

**Slow start:** Congestion window (cwnd) starts at 1 MSS. Doubles each RTT (exponential growth).

```
TCP_SLOW_START():
    cwnd = 1 * MSS
    ssthresh = Infinity
    while true:
        send min(cwnd, receiver_window) bytes
        if timeout:
            ssthresh = cwnd / 2
            cwnd = 1 * MSS  // restart slow start
        else if 3 duplicate ACKs:
            ssthresh = cwnd / 2
            cwnd = ssthresh  // fast recovery
        if cwnd >= ssthresh:
            enter congestion avoidance
```

**Congestion avoidance:** Linear growth (increase cwnd by 1 MSS per RTT).

**Fast recovery:** On 3 duplicate ACKs, halve cwnd (set to ssthresh) instead of resetting to 1.

**Phases:**

| Phase                | cwnd Growth    | Trigger                   |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Slow start           | Exponential    | Connection start, timeout |
| Congestion avoidance | Linear         | cwnd ≥ ssthresh           |
| Fast recovery        | —              | 3 duplicate ACKs          |
| Timeout (RTO)        | Reset to 1 MSS | Timeout                   |

## 6. Application Layer

### 6.1 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

**Request methods:**

| Method | Purpose            | Idempotent | Has body |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| GET    | Retrieve resource  | Yes        | No       |
| POST   | Create/submit data | No         | Yes      |
| PUT    | Replace resource   | Yes        | Yes      |
| DELETE | Remove resource    | Yes        | No       |
| PATCH  | Partial update     | No         | Yes      |
| HEAD   | Get headers only   | Yes        | No       |

**Status codes:**

- **2xx:** Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
- **3xx:** Redirection (301 Moved Permanently, 304 Not Modified)
- **4xx:** Client error (400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found)
- **5xx:** Server error (500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)

**HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3:**

| Feature       | HTTP/1.1     | HTTP/2           | HTTP/3      |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Transport     | TCP          | TCP              | QUIC (UDP)  |
| Connections   | 1 per domain | Multiplexed      | Multiplexed |
| Header format | Text         | HPACK compressed | QPACK       |
| Ordering      | HOL blocking | HOL on TCP       | No HOL      |

### 6.2 DNS (Domain Name System)

Hierarchical, distributed database mapping domain names to IP addresses.

**Record types:**

| Type  | Purpose                   |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| A     | IPv4 address              |
| AAAA  | IPv6 address              |
| CNAME | Canonical name (alias)    |
| MX    | Mail exchange server      |
| NS    | Authoritative name server |
| TXT   | Text data                 |

**Resolution process:**

```
DNS_RESOLVE(domain):
    check local cache
    query recursive resolver
        if not cached:
            query root server → TLD server → authoritative server
    cache result
    return IP address
```

### 6.3 SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

**Email flow:**

```
Sender MUA → Sender MTA (SMTP) → Intermediate MTA(s) → Receiver MTA (SMTP) → Receiver MUA (IMAP/POP3)
```

**SMTP commands:**

```
HELO hostname       // Greet
MAIL FROM: <addr>   // Sender
RCPT TO: <addr>     // Recipient
DATA                // Start message body
Subject: ...
<Message body>
.                   // End message
QUIT                // Close
```

### 6.4 Other Application Protocols

| Protocol | Port  | Purpose                      |
| -------- | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| FTP      | 20/21 | File transfer (control/data) |
| SSH      | 22    | Secure shell                 |
| DHCP     | 67/68 | Auto IP configuration        |
| IMAP     | 143   | Email access (server-side)   |
| POP3     | 110   | Email download               |
| HTTPS    | 443   | HTTP over TLS                |
| DNS      | 53    | Name resolution              |

## 7. Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing TCP and UDP use cases.** TCP adds overhead for reliability, flow control, and
   congestion control. Use UDP for low-latency applications where occasional packet loss is
   acceptable (gaming, streaming, DNS).

2. **Forgetting the TCP three-way handshake cost.** Every TCP connection requires a full round trip
   before data transfer begins. For short-lived connections, this overhead is significant. Use
   connection pooling.

3. **Underestimating the importance of MTU.** If a packet exceeds the Maximum Transmission Unit, it
   gets fragmented. Fragmentation increases overhead and reassembly complexity. Path MTU discovery
   helps avoid this.

4. **Ignoring subnet mask errors.** An incorrect subnet mask causes packets to be sent to the wrong
   gateway or subnet. Always double-check CIDR notation and subnet masks.

5. **Misunderstanding ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).** ARP maps IP to MAC addresses and is
   broadcast-based. It works only within a broadcast domain. Routers use their own MAC addresses,
   not the destination's.

6. **HTTP/1.1 head-of-line blocking.** In HTTP/1.1, one slow response blocks subsequent responses on
   the same TCP connection. This is solved by HTTP/2 multiplexing or opening multiple connections.

7. **DNS caching issues.** Long TTL values improve performance but delay propagation of changes.
   Short TTL values increase DNS query volume. Choose based on how often records change.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Subnet Calculation

**Problem:** An organisation has IP address 192.168.1.0/24 and needs to create 6 subnets of roughly
equal size. Determine the subnet mask and the address range for each subnet. **Solution:** 6 subnets
requires 3 bits (2^3 = 8 subnets). New mask: /24 + 3 = /27 (255.255.255.224). Block size: 256 - 224
= 32 addresses per subnet (30 usable). Subnets: 192.168.1.0/27 (hosts 1-30), 192.168.1.32/27 (hosts
33-62), 192.168.1.64/27 (hosts 65-94), 192.168.1.96/27 (hosts 97-126), 192.168.1.128/27 (hosts
129-158), 192.168.1.160/27 (hosts 161-190), 192.168.1.192/27, 192.168.1.224/27.

### Example 2: TCP Three-Way Handshake

**Problem:** Describe the TCP three-way handshake and explain the purpose of each segment's flags.
**Solution:** Client sends SYN (seq=x). Server responds with SYN-ACK (seq=y, ack=x+1). Client sends
ACK (ack=y+1). The SYN flag requests connection establishment and carries the initial sequence
number. The SYN-ACK acknowledges the client's SYN and provides the server’s initial sequence number.
The final ACK acknowledges the server's SYN. After this exchange, both sides have established their
sequence numbers and the connection is established for full-duplex data transfer.
