### Dependency Graph

The key dependencies among topics are:

- **Groups** $\to$ Subgroups $\to$ Lagrange's Theorem $\to$ Normal Subgroups $\to$ Quotient Groups
- **Homomorphisms** $\to$ Isomorphism Theorems $\to$ Correspondence Theorem
- **Group Actions** $\to$ Orbit-Stabilizer $\to$ Sylow Theorems $\to$ Applications
- **Rings** $\to$ Ideals $\to$ Quotient Rings $\to$ Prime/Maximal Ideals
- **Polynomial Rings** $\to$ Euclidean Domains $\to$ PIDs $\to$ UFDs
- **Field Extensions** $\to$ Algebraic Extensions $\to$ Splitting Fields $\to$ Galois Theory

Mastering the earlier topics is essential before proceeding to the later ones. The problem set
(Section 18) Is designed to test understanding across all these areas.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing groups, rings, and fields.** Group: one operation, inverses, identity. Ring: two
  operations (addition, multiplication). Field: ring where every non-zero element has a
  multiplicative inverse. **Fix:** $\mathbb{Z}$ is a ring but not a field ($2$ has no multiplicative
  inverse). $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$ are fields.
- **Wrong subgroup test.** A subset $H \leq G$ must contain the identity, be closed under the
  operation and inverses. **Fix:** For finite groups, it suffices to check closure: if $H$ is
  non-empty and closed, then $H \leq G$.
- **Confusing normal subgroups and general subgroups.** Normal subgroups satisfy $gHg^{-1} = H$ for
  all $g \in G$; they allow quotient group construction. **Fix:** Abelian groups: all subgroups are
  normal. Non-abelian: check $gH = Hg$ for all $g$.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Group verification

**Problem.** Show that $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$ is a group for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Solution.** (1) Closure: $[a] + [b] = [a + b \bmod n] \in \mathbb{Z}_n$. (2) Associativity:
inherited from $\mathbb{Z}$. (3) Identity: $[0]$. (4) Inverse: $[a]^{-1} = [-a] = [n - a]$.
Therefore $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$ is a group. $\blacksquare$

### Example 2: Lagrange's theorem

**Problem.** $G = S_3$ has order 6. A subgroup $H = \{e, (12)\}$ has order 2. Verify Lagrange's
theorem.

**Solution.** $|G| = 6$, $|H| = 2$. $2 \mid 6$, so Lagrange's theorem is satisfied: $|H|$ divides
$|G|$. The index $[G : H] = |G|/|H| = 3$, and the cosets are $H$, $(13)H = \{(13), (132)\}$,
$(23)H = \{(23), (123)\}$.

$\blacksquare$

## Summary

- Group: set with associative binary operation, identity, inverses. Abelian if commutative.
- Lagrange's theorem: $|H|$ divides $|G|$ for $H \leq G$; the index $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$.
- Cyclic group: generated by a single element $\langle g \rangle$; $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is cyclic.
- Ring: abelian group under $+$, monoid under $\times$, distributive laws. Field: ring where every
  non-zero element is invertible.
