| Banach-Alaoglu       | Closed unit ball of $X^*$ is weak\*-compact                                                         |

:::caution Common Pitfall The Closed Graph Theorem requires both the domain and codomain to be
Banach spaces. A linear operator $T : C[0,1] \to C[0,1]$ defined by $Tf = f'$ (where defined) has a
closed graph in $C[0,1] \times C[0,1]$, but $C^1[0,1]$ is not complete under the $C[0,1]$ norm. The
theorem does not apply, and $T$ is indeed unbounded.
