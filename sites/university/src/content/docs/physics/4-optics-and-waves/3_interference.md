### 3.1 Superposition Principle

When two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement is the sum of the individual
displacements. For two coherent waves with amplitudes $E_1$ and $E_2$:

$$E = E_1 + E_2 = E_0 \cos(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - \omega t + \phi_1) + E_0 \cos(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - \omega t + \phi_2)$$

The time-averaged intensity is:

$$I = I_1 + I_2 + 2\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\cos\Delta\phi$$

Where $\Delta\phi = \phi_2 - \phi_1$ is the phase difference.

### 3.2 Double-Slit Interference (Young's Experiment)

Two slits separated by distance $d$ are illuminated by coherent light of wavelength $\lambda$. The
Screen is at distance $L \gg d$.

**Condition for bright fringes (constructive interference):**

$$d\sin\theta = m\lambda, \quad m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$$

**Condition for dark fringes (destructive interference):**

$$d\sin\theta = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda, \quad m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$$

**Derivation.** The path difference between the two slits is $\Delta = d\sin\theta$. Constructive
Interference occurs when $\Delta = m\lambda$ (phase difference $2m\pi$), and destructive when
$\Delta = (m + 1/2)\lambda$ (phase difference $(2m+1)\pi$). $\blacksquare$

The fringe spacing on the screen:

$$\Delta y = \frac{\lambda L}{d}$$

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Double-slit fringe calculation</summary>

**Problem.** In a Young's double-slit experiment, light of wavelength $\lambda = 550$ nm passes
Through slits separated by $d = 0.10$ mm onto a screen at $L = 2.0$ m. Find (a) the fringe spacing,
(b) the angular position of the third bright fringe, and (c) the total number of bright fringes
Visible within the central diffraction maximum (slit width $a = 0.020$ mm).

**Solution.**

(a) $\Delta y = \lambda L/d = (550 \times 10^{-9})(2.0)/(0.10 \times 10^{-3}) = 11.0 \times 10^{-3}$
m $= 11.0$ mm.

(b)
$d\sin\theta_3 = 3\lambda \implies \sin\theta_3 = 3(550 \times 10^{-9})/(0.10 \times 10^{-3}) = 0.0165$
$\theta_3 = 0.945°$.

(c) The diffraction envelope has its first minimum at
$\sin\theta = \lambda/a = 550/20 = 27.5 \times 10^{-3}$ Corresponding to interference order
$m = d\sin\theta/\lambda = (d/a) = 0.10/0.020 = 5$. Missing orders at $m = \pm 5, \pm 10, \ldots$.
Visible bright fringes: $m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4$ Giving 9 bright fringes within the
central maximum.

### 3.3 Thin-Film Interference

Light reflecting from a thin film of thickness $t$ and refractive index $n$ undergoes interference
Between the wave reflected from the top surface and the wave reflected from the bottom surface.

**Path difference:** $2nt\cos\theta_t$ where $\theta_t$ is the angle of refraction inside the film.

A phase shift of $\pi$ occurs upon reflection from a medium of higher refractive index. The
condition For constructive interference (bright reflection) is:

$$2nt\cos\theta_t = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda \quad \mathrm{(one\ phase\ shift)}$$

$$2nt\cos\theta_t = m\lambda \quad \mathrm{(zero\ or\ two\ phase\ shifts)}$$

:::caution Common Pitfall Always count the number of $\pi$ phase shifts that occur upon reflection.
A reflection from Low-to-high refractive index introduces a $\pi$ shift; high-to-low does not. For a
soap film in Air, there is one $\pi$ shift (at the top surface). For a coating on glass
($n_{\mathrm{coat} \lt n_{\mathrm{glass}}}$), there is also one shift. The conditions for
constructive and destructive interference swap depending on whether the total number of shifts is
odd or even.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Anti-reflection coating design</summary>

**Problem.** Magnesium fluoride ($n = 1.38$) is used as an anti-reflection coating on a glass lens
($n_{\mathrm{glass} = 1.52}$). Find the minimum coating thickness for destructive interference in
Reflected light at $\lambda = 550$ nm (normal incidence).

**Solution.** At the air-coating interface (low to high $n$): $\pi$ phase shift. At the
coating-glass interface (low to high $n$): $\pi$ phase shift. Total: two phase shifts $\equiv$ zero
net phase shift from reflections.

For destructive interference (dark reflection) with zero net phase shift: $2nt = (m + 1/2)\lambda$.

Minimum thickness ($m = 0$): $t = \lambda/(4n) = 550/(4 \times 1.38) = 99.6$ nm.

This is the standard quarter-wave anti-reflection coating design.

<summary>Worked Example: Soap film colours</summary>

**Problem.** A soap film ($n = 1.33$) of thickness $t = 300$ nm is illuminated by white light at
Normal incidence. Which visible wavelengths are strongly reflected?

**Solution.** Air-soap (low to high): one $\pi$ phase shift. Soap-air (high to low): no shift.
Total: one phase shift. Constructive: $2nt = (m + 1/2)\lambda$.

$\lambda = 2nt/(m + 1/2) = 2(1.33)(300)/(m + 1/2) = 798/(m + 1/2)$ nm.

$m = 0$: $\lambda = 1596$ nm (infrared, not visible). $m = 1$: $\lambda = 798/1.5 = 532$ nm (green,
visible). $m = 2$: $\lambda = 798/2.5 = 319$ nm (ultraviolet, not visible).

The film appears green in reflected light.

### 3.4 Michelson Interferometer

A beam splitter divides light into two beams that travel perpendicular paths and recombine. The path
Difference $\Delta = 2(d_1 - d_2)$ determines the interference pattern.

Moving mirror $M_1$ by distance $\Delta d$ shifts the pattern by $m = 2\Delta d / \lambda$ fringes.

The Michelson interferometer is used for precise length measurements, the determination of
Refractive indices, and was historically crucial in establishing the invariance of the speed of
Light (Michelson-Morley experiment).

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Michelson interferometer mirror displacement</summary>

**Problem.** A Michelson interferometer uses a HeNe laser ($\lambda = 632.8$ nm). When one mirror Is
displaced, 2000 fringes cross a reference point. How far was the mirror moved?

**Solution.** Each fringe corresponds to a path difference change of $\lambda$. Moving the mirror by
$\Delta d$ changes the path difference by $2\Delta d$:

$m = 2\Delta d/\lambda \implies \Delta d = m\lambda/2 = 2000 \times 632.8 \times 10^{-9}/2 = 6.328 \times 10^{-4}$
m $= 0.633$ mm.

### 3.5 Coherence Length and Fringe Visibility

The **fringe visibility** (or contrast) quantifies the sharpness of interference fringes:

$$\mathcal{V} = \frac{I_{\max} - I_{\min}}{I_{\max} + I_{\min}}$$

For two-beam interference with intensities $I_1$, $I_2$ and degree of temporal coherence $|\gamma|$:

$$\mathcal{V} = \frac{2\sqrt{I_1 I_2}}{I_1 + I_2}\,|\gamma(\tau)|$$

For equal intensities ($I_1 = I_2$): $\mathcal{V} = |\gamma(\tau)|$.

The coherence function decays with path difference. For a Gaussian spectral profile of width
$\Delta\lambda$:

$$|\gamma(\tau)| = \exp\!\left[-\pi\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda \cdot \Delta x}{\lambda^2}\right)^2\right]$$

Where $\Delta x = c\tau$ is the path difference. Fringes become unresolvable when
$\Delta x \approx \lambda^2/\Delta\lambda = L_c$The **coherence length**.

**Implication for interferometry.** To observe interference fringes, the path difference between The
two arms must satisfy $\Delta x \ll L_c$. A sodium lamp ($\Delta\lambda \approx 0.6$ nm at
$\lambda = 589$ nm) gives $L_c \approx 0.58$ mm. A HeNe laser ($\Delta\lambda \approx 10^{-6}$ nm)
Gives $L_c \approx 350$ m — fringes are visible over enormous path differences.

### 3.6 Multiple-Beam Interference: The Fabry-Perot Etalon

A **Fabry-Perot etalon** consists of two parallel, partially reflecting surfaces separated by
Distance $d$. Multiple reflections create many beams that interfere, producing sharp transmission
Peaks.

For a lossless etalon with reflectance $R$ and transmittance $T = 1 - R$Illuminated at angle
$\theta$ inside a medium of refractive index $n$:

$$\frac{I_T}{I_0} = \frac{T^2}{(1 - R)^2 + 4R\sin^2(\delta/2)} = \frac{1}{1 + F\sin^2(\delta/2)}$$

Where $\delta = (4\pi/\lambda)\,nd\cos\theta$ is the round-trip phase and $F = 4R/(1-R)^2$ is the
**coefficient of finesse**.

**Transmission maxima** occur when $\delta = 2m\pi$ ($m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$), i.e.,
$2nd\cos\theta = m\lambda$.

**Finesse:**

$$\mathcal{F} = \frac{\pi\sqrt{F}}{2} = \frac{\pi\sqrt{R}}{1 - R}$$

The finesse determines the sharpness of the peaks: higher $R$ gives sharper peaks.

**Free spectral range** (frequency spacing between adjacent peaks):

$$\Delta\nu_{\mathrm{FSR} = \frac{c}{2nd}}$$

**Resolving power:**

$$\mathcal{R} = \frac{\lambda}{\delta\lambda} = m\mathcal{F}$$

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Fabry-Perot resolving power</summary>

**Problem.** A Fabry-Perot etalon has plate separation $d = 1.00$ mm, refractive index $n = 1.00$
And reflectance $R = 0.90$. Find the finesse, free spectral range, and minimum resolvable wavelength
Difference at $\lambda = 500$ nm (normal incidence).

**Solution.** Finesse: $\mathcal{F} = \pi\sqrt{0.90}/(1 - 0.90) = \pi(0.949)/0.10 = 29.8$.

Free spectral range:
$\Delta\nu_{\mathrm{FSR} = c/(2nd) = (3 \times 10^8)/(2 \times 1.00 \times 10^{-3}) = 1.50 \times 10^{11}}$
Hz.

Order number: $m = 2nd/\lambda = 2(1.00)(1.00 \times 10^{-3})/(500 \times 10^{-9}) = 4000$.

Resolving power: $\mathcal{R} = m\mathcal{F} = 4000 \times 29.8 = 1.19 \times 10^5$.

Minimum resolvable wavelength:
$\delta\lambda = \lambda/\mathcal{R} = 500/1.19 \times 10^5 = 4.20 \times 10^{-3}$ nm $= 4.20$ pm.
