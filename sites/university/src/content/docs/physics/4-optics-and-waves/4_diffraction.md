### 4.1 Huygens-Fresnel Principle

Every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The new wavefront is
the Envelope of these wavelets, accounting for both amplitude and phase.

**Kirchhoff diffraction integral.** The field at point $P$ due to an aperture in a screen is:

$$E(P) = \frac{i}{\lambda}\iint_{\mathrm{aperture} E(Q)\,\frac{e^{-ikr}}{r}\cos\theta\,dS}$$

Where $E(Q)$ is the field at the aperture point $Q$, $r$ is the distance from $Q$ to $P$And $\theta$
Is the angle between the normal to the aperture and the direction to $P$. The obliquity factor
$\cos\theta$ ensures that wavelets do not propagate backwards. In the Fraunhofer limit
($r \to \infty$), This integral reduces to the Fourier transform of the aperture function (see
Sections 4.8 and 7.1).

### 4.2 Single-Slit Diffraction

A slit of width $a$ is illuminated by plane waves of wavelength $\lambda$.

**Intensity distribution (Fraunhofer diffraction):**

$$I(\theta) = I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right)^2$$

Where $\alpha = \frac{\pi a \sin\theta}{\lambda}$.

**Derivation.** Divide the slit into infinitesimal elements of width $dy$ at position $y$. Each
Element contributes a wavelet. The field at angle $\theta$ on a distant screen:

$$E(\theta) = \int_{-a/2}^{a/2} E_0\, e^{iky\sin\theta}\,dy = E_0 \frac{\sin\left(\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}\right)}{\frac{k\sin\theta}{2}} = E_0 a \frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}$$

Where $\alpha = ka\sin\theta/2 = \pi a\sin\theta/\lambda$. Since $I \propto |E|^2$:

$$I(\theta) = I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right)^2$$

$\blacksquare$

**Minima:** $\alpha = m\pi$I.e., $a\sin\theta = m\lambda$ for $m = \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$

**Central maximum:** at $\theta = 0$With width (first zero to first zero)
$\Delta\theta = 2\lambda/a$.

The secondary maxima occur approximately midway between consecutive minima. Their intensities are:
$I_1/I_0 \approx 0.045$ (first secondary), $I_2/I_0 \approx 0.016$ (second), decreasing rapidly.

<summary>Worked Example: Single-slit diffraction intensity</summary>

**Problem.** Light of wavelength $\lambda = 580$ nm passes through a slit of width $a = 0.10$ mm.
Find (a) the angular width of the central maximum, and (b) the intensity at $\theta = 0.50°$
Relative to the central maximum.

**Solution.**

(a) First minimum at
$\sin\theta_1 = \lambda/a = 580 \times 10^{-9}/(0.10 \times 10^{-3}) = 5.80 \times 10^{-3}$ So
$\theta_1 = 0.332°$. Angular width of central maximum: $2\theta_1 = 0.664°$.

(b) $\alpha = \pi a\sin\theta/\lambda = \pi(0.10 \times 10^{-3})\sin(0.50°)/(580 \times 10^{-9})$
$= \pi(0.10 \times 10^{-3})(8.73 \times 10^{-3})/(580 \times 10^{-9}) = \pi(1.505) = 4.73$.

$I/I_0 = (\sin\alpha/\alpha)^2 = (\sin 4.73/4.73)^2 = (-0.9998/4.73)^2 = (0.2114)^2 = 0.0447$.

The intensity is about 4.5% of the central maximum.

:::caution Common Pitfall The condition for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction is
$a\sin\theta = \lambda$ (not $\lambda/2$). The factor of 2 difference from the double-slit maximum
condition ($d\sin\theta = \lambda$) Reflects the fundamentally different geometry: in single-slit
diffraction, the minimum occurs when Wavelets from the edges cancel, requiring a path difference of
one full wavelength between them.

### 4.3 Double-Slit with Finite Width

Combining single-slit diffraction and double-slit interference:

$$I(\theta) = I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right)^2 \cos^2\beta$$

Where $\alpha = \pi a\sin\theta/\lambda$ (diffraction envelope) and
$\beta = \pi d\sin\theta/\lambda$ (interference fringes).

The interference fringes are modulated by the diffraction envelope. **Missing orders** occur when
$\beta = m\pi$ coincides with $\alpha = n\pi$I.e., when $d/a$ is a ratio of integers.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Missing orders in a double-slit pattern</summary>

**Problem.** A double slit has slit width $a = 0.040$ mm and slit separation $d = 0.20$ mm,
illuminated By light of wavelength $\lambda = 550$ nm. (a) Which interference orders are missing?
(b) How many Bright fringes appear within the central diffraction envelope?

**Solution.**

(a) Missing orders occur when $d/a$ is an integer: $d/a = 0.20/0.04 = 5$. The interference orders
$m = \pm 5, \pm 10, \ldots$ coincide with diffraction minima and are missing.

(b) The central diffraction envelope extends from $\theta = -\lambda/a$ to $\theta = +\lambda/a$.
The highest visible order satisfies $d\sin\theta \lt d(\lambda/a) = (d/a)\lambda = 5\lambda$ I.e.,
$m \lt 5$. So orders $m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4$ are visible: 9 bright fringes Within the
central envelope.

### 4.4 Diffraction Gratings

A grating with $N$ slits, each of width $a$Separated by distance $d$:

$$I(\theta) = I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\sin N\beta}{\sin\beta}\right)^2$$

**Principal maxima:** $d\sin\theta = m\lambda$ ($m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$).

The angular width of a principal maximum is $\Delta\theta = \lambda/(Nd\cos\theta)$. The **resolving
power** of a grating is:

$$R = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda} = mN$$

Where $N$ is the total number of illuminated slits.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Grating resolving power</summary>

**Problem.** A diffraction grating has 5000 lines/cm and is 5.0 cm wide. Find the resolving power In
the first order and the minimum resolvable wavelength difference at $\lambda = 600$ nm.

**Solution.** Total number of slits: $N = 5000 \times 5.0 = 25000$. Slit spacing: $d = 1/5000$ cm
$= 2.00 \times 10^{-6}$ m $= 2.00$ $\mu$M.

Resolving power: $R = mN = 1 \times 25000 = 25000$.

Minimum resolvable wavelength difference: $\delta\lambda = \lambda/R = 600/25000 = 0.024$ nm.

### 4.5 The Rayleigh Criterion

Two point sources are just resolvable when the central maximum of one coincides with the first
minimum Of the other:

$$\theta_{\mathrm{min} = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D}}$$

Where $D$ is the aperture diameter (for a circular aperture).

### 4.6 Fresnel vs. Fraunhofer Diffraction

**Fraunhofer (far-field):** Source and screen are at infinity (or at the focal plane of a lens).
Requires $a^2/\lambda \ll L$ (Fresnel number $N_F \ll 1$).

**Fresnel (near-field):** Source and/or screen are at finite distances. The Fresnel number
$N_F = a^2/(\lambda L)$ characterises the regime. Fresnel diffraction uses Fresnel integrals and
Produces patterns that depend on the distance.

### 4.7 Circular Aperture and the Airy Disk

For a circular aperture of diameter $D$The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is an **Airy pattern**:

$$I(\theta) = I_0 \left[\frac{2J_1(\beta)}{\beta}\right]^2$$

Where $\beta = \pi D \sin\theta / \lambda$ and $J_1$ is the first-order Bessel function of the first
Kind.

**Derivation.** The field in the Fraunhofer limit is the Fourier transform of the circular aperture
Function $t(r) = 1$ for $r \leq D/2$ and $0$ otherwise. In polar coordinates:

$$E(\theta) \propto \int_0^{D/2} J_0(kr\sin\theta)\, r\,dr = \frac{D}{2}\frac{J_1(\beta)}{\beta}$$

Where we used the identity $\int_0^a J_0(\rho r)\,r\,dr = aJ_1(\rho a)/\rho$. Since
$I \propto |E|^2$ The result follows. $\blacksquare$

The first zero of $J_1(\beta)$ is at $\beta = 1.22\pi$Giving:

$$\sin\theta_1 = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D}$$

The bright central disk (the **Airy disk**) subtends an angle:

$$\theta_{\mathrm{Airy} = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D}}$$

This is the basis of the **Rayleigh criterion** for resolving power of circular apertures
(telescopes, Microscopes, the eye). Approximately 84% of the total transmitted power falls within
the Airy disk.

<details>
<summary>Worked Example: Telescope resolving power</summary>

**Problem.** A telescope has a primary mirror of diameter $D = 150$ mm. Find its angular resolution
At $\lambda = 550$ nm. Two stars are separated by $0.50''$ (arcseconds). Can this telescope resolve
Them?

**Solution.** Angular resolution:
$\theta_{\min} = 1.22\lambda/D = 1.22(550 \times 10^{-9})/(0.150) = 4.47 \times 10^{-6}$ rad.

Convert to arcseconds: $4.47 \times 10^{-6} \times (180/\pi) \times 3600 = 0.923''$.

Since $0.50'' \lt 0.923''$The telescope cannot resolve these two stars — they would appear as a
Single blurred source.

### 4.8 Introduction to Fourier Optics

The Fraunhofer diffraction integral has a deep connection with Fourier analysis. For an aperture
With transmission function $t(x, y)$The far-field diffraction pattern is:

$$E(\theta_x, \theta_y) \propto \iint t(x,y)\, e^{-i(k_x x + k_y y)}\,dx\,dy$$

Where $k_x = k\sin\theta_x$ and $k_y = k\sin\theta_y$. This is precisely the **two-dimensional
Fourier transform** of $t(x,y)$Evaluated at spatial frequencies $k_x/(2\pi)$ and $k_y/(2\pi)$.

**Key consequences:**

1. A lens of focal length $f$Placed one focal length after the aperture, produces the Fourier
   transform at its back focal plane — it performs an **optical Fourier transform**.
2. Narrow features in the aperture (small $a$) produce broad diffraction patterns (large spread in
   $k$-space), and vice versa — the optical analogue of the uncertainty principle.
3. Spatial filtering: by placing masks in the Fourier plane, one can selectively remove or enhance
   spatial frequency components, modifying the image (the basis of optical image processing).

**Example.** A single slit of width $a$ has aperture function $t(x) = \mathrm{rect}(x/a)$. Its
Fourier Transform is $\mathrm{sinc}(\pi a \sin\theta/\lambda)$Directly giving the single-slit
diffraction Pattern. A periodic grating has sharp peaks in the Fourier transform (the diffraction
orders), each Corresponding to a spatial harmonic of the grating.

**Spatial filtering.** A powerful application of Fourier optics is the manipulation of images by
Modifying their spatial frequency content:

- **Low-pass filter:** A small aperture in the Fourier plane passes only the zeroth and low-order
  diffraction, removing fine detail (smoothing).
- **High-pass filter:** An opaque spot blocking the zeroth order removes the DC component, enhancing
  edges and fine structure (phase contrast microscopy).
- **Band-pass filter:** Selective removal of specific spatial frequencies (e.g., removing periodic
  noise from an image).

**Phase contrast microscopy** (Zernike, 1953) is a celebrated application. Biological specimens are
Mostly transparent (phase objects) and produce no intensity contrast in ordinary microscopy. By
Introducing a $\pi/2$ phase shift to the undiffracted (zeroth-order) light in the Fourier plane,
Phase variations are converted to intensity variations, making transparent structures visible.

<summary>Worked Example: Fourier analysis of a double slit</summary>

**Problem.** A double slit has width $a$ and centre-to-centre separation $d = 3a$. Use Fourier
optics To predict the diffraction pattern and identify the missing orders.

**Solution.** The aperture function is
$t(x) = \mathrm{rect}(x/a) * [\delta(x - 3a/2) + \delta(x + 3a/2)]$ I.e., the convolution of a
single-slit function with two delta functions.

By the convolution theorem, the Fourier transform is the product of a sinc function (single slit)
and $\cos(\pi d \sin\theta/\lambda)$ (two-point interference):

$E(\theta) \propto \mathrm{sinc}(\pi a\sin\theta/\lambda) \cdot \cos(\pi \cdot 3a \sin\theta/\lambda)$

The sinc envelope has zeros at $a\sin\theta = m\lambda$. The cosine fringes have maxima at
$3a\sin\theta = m\lambda$. Missing orders when $3a\sin\theta = 3\lambda$ coincides with
$a\sin\theta = \lambda$: the third order ($m = 3$) and all multiples of 3 are missing. This confirms
$d/a = 3$ as the ratio for missing orders.
