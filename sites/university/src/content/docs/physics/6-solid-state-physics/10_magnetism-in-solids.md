### 10.1 Types of Magnetism

- **Diamagnetism:** Weak, negative susceptibility ($\chi \lt 0$). Present in all materials. Arises
  from the orbital response to an applied field (Lenz's law). $\chi_d \sim -10^{-5}$.
- **Paramagnetism:** Positive susceptibility ($\chi \gt 0$). Unpaired spins align with the field.
  Curie law: $\chi = C/T$ where $C = N\mu_0\mu_{\mathrm{eff}^2/(3k_B)}$.
- **Ferromagnetism:** Large positive susceptibility. Spontaneous magnetisation below the Curie
  temperature $T_C$.
- **Antiferromagnetism:** Adjacent spins antiparallel. Susceptibility peaks at the Néel temperature
  $T_N$.
- **Ferrimagnetism:** Antiparallel spins of unequal magnitude. Net magnetisation (e.g., magnetite).

### 10.2 Diamagnetism

Diamagnetism is the universal tendency of matter to weakly oppose an applied magnetic field.

**Langevin diamagnetism.** For an atom with $Z$ electrons, each in a circular orbit of radius
$\langle r^2 \rangle$A field $B$ along $z$ modifies the angular velocity by
$\Delta\omega = eB/(2m_e)$. The induced magnetic moment per atom:

$$\mu_{\mathrm{dia} = -\frac{e^2 B}{6m_e}\sum_{i=1}^{Z}\langle r_i^2 \rangle = -\frac{e^2 Z B}{6m_e}\langle r^2 \rangle}$$

The susceptibility (per unit volume, with $n$ atoms per unit volume):

$$\chi_L = -\frac{\mu_0 n e^2 Z \langle r^2 \rangle}{6m_e}$$

This is independent of temperature and very small: $\chi_L \sim -10^{-5}$.

**Landau diamagnetism.** Free electrons also exhibit diamagnetism. The quantisation of electron
Orbits into Landau levels modifies the ground-state energy in an applied field:

$$\chi_{\mathrm{Landau} = -\frac{1}{3}\chi_P = -\frac{\mu_0 \mu_B^2 g(\varepsilon_F)}{3}}$$

Where $\chi_P$ is the Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility. The total susceptibility of a free electron
Gas is $\chi = \chi_P + \chi_{\mathrm{Landau} = \frac{2}{3}\chi_P}$ (still paramagnetic, but Reduced
by one-third).

### 10.3 Paramagnetism

**Langevin paramagnetism (classical).** For $N$ non-interacting magnetic moments $\boldsymbol{\mu}$
Of magnitude $\mu$ in a field $B$:

$$M = N\mu\, L(\mu B/k_B T)$$

Where $L(x) = \coth x - 1/x$ is the Langevin function. At high temperature ($\mu B \ll k_B T$):

$$L(x) \approx \frac{x}{3} \implies M \approx \frac{N\mu^2 B}{3k_B T}$$

Giving the **Curie law** $\chi = C/T$ with $C = N\mu_0\mu^2/(3k_B)$.

**Quantum treatment (Brillouin function).** For angular momentum $J$ with $g_J$ the Landé g-factor,
The magnetisation is:

$$M = Ng_J\mu_B J\, B_J(x)$$

Where $x = g_J\mu_B J B/(k_B T)$ and
$B_J(x) = \frac{2J+1}{2J}\coth\left(\frac{2J+1}{2J}x\right) - \frac{1}{2J}\coth\left(\frac{x}{2J}\right)$
Is the Brillouin function. For $J = 1/2$ (spin-1/2), $B_{1/2}(x) = \tanh x$.

**Pauli paramagnetism.** In a metal, the conduction electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas. Only
Electrons near $\varepsilon_F$ can flip their spins in response to a field:

$$\chi_P = \mu_0\mu_B^2\,g(\varepsilon_F) = \frac{3\mu_0\mu_B^2 N}{2\varepsilon_F}$$

This is temperature-independent (up to corrections of order $(T/T_F)^2$), in contrast to the Curie
Law. The ratio $\chi_P/\chi_{\mathrm{Curie} \sim T/T_F \sim 10^{-2}}$ at room temperature,
Explaining why metals are only weakly paramagnetic.

### 10.4 Ferromagnetism and the Mean-Field Theory

In the **mean-field (Weiss) model**, each spin experiences an effective field:

$$B_{\mathrm{eff} = B_0 + \lambda M}$$

Where $\lambda$ is the molecular field constant and $M$ is the magnetisation.

The spontaneous magnetisation satisfies:

$$M = N\mu_B\tanh\left(\frac{\mu_B(B_0 + \lambda M)}{k_B T}\right)$$

Setting $B_0 = 0$ and expanding for small $M$ near $T_C$:

$$M \approx \frac{N\mu_B^2\lambda M}{k_B T_C}$$

Giving the **Curie temperature:** $T_C = N\mu_B^2\lambda/k_B$.

The critical exponent $\beta = 1/2$ (mean-field value), compared with the experimental value
$\beta \approx 1/3$ (3D Ising universality class).

Above $T_C$The susceptibility follows the **Curie--Weiss law:**

$$\chi = \frac{C}{T - T_C}$$

<summary>Worked Example: Curie Temperature of Iron</summary>

Iron has $N = 8.49 \times 10^{28}$ atoms/m$^3$Magnetic moment $\mu = 2.22\,\mu_B$ per atom, And
$T_C = 1043$ K. From $T_C = N\mu^2\lambda/(3k_B)$:

$$\lambda = \frac{3k_B T_C}{N\mu^2} = \frac{3 \times 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \times 1043}{8.49 \times 10^{28} \times (2.22 \times 9.274 \times 10^{-24})^2}$$

$$\lambda = \frac{4.32 \times 10^{-20}}{8.49 \times 10^{28} \times 4.25 \times 10^{-46}} = \frac{4.32 \times 10^{-20}}{3.61 \times 10^{-17}} = 1.20 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{T}\,m/A$$

The corresponding exchange field at $T = 0$ ($M = N\mu$):

$$B_{\mathrm{ex} = \lambda M = 1.20 \times 10^{-3} \times 8.49 \times 10^{28} \times 2.22 \times 9.274 \times 10^{-24} = 2100\ \mathrm{T}}$$

This enormous effective field is purely quantum-mechanical in origin (exchange interaction).

### 10.5 Magnetic Domains

Below $T_C$A ferromagnet divides into **domains** of uniform magnetisation, separated by **domain
Walls** (Bloch walls). Domain formation reduces the magnetostatic energy.

The **domain wall width:** $\delta \sim \sqrt{A/K}$ where $A$ is the exchange stiffness and $K$ is
the Anisotropy constant. Typical values: $\delta \sim 100$ nm.

The wall energy per unit area: $\sigma_w \sim 4\sqrt{AK}$.

### 10.6 Magnetic Ordering

**Antiferromagnetism.** In antiferromagnets (e.g., MnO, NiO), adjacent spins align antiparallel due
To negative exchange interaction $J \lt 0$. The Néel temperature is:

$$T_N = \frac{\lvert J\rvert z S(S+1)}{3k_B}$$

Where $z$ is the number of nearest neighbours. The susceptibility peaks at $T_N$ and decreases at
Both higher and lower temperatures.

**Ferrimagnetism.** In ferrimagnets (e.g., Fe$_3$O$_4$), antiparallel sublattices have different
Magnetic moments, giving a net spontaneous magnetisation. The temperature dependence of $M(T)$ is
More complex than for simple ferromagnets.

**Heisenberg model.** The exchange interaction between neighbouring spins is described by:

$$\hat{H} = -\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} J_{ij}\,\hat{\mathbf{S}}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{S}}_j$$

For $J \gt 0$: ferromagnetic coupling (spins parallel). For $J \lt 0$: antiferromagnetic coupling
(spins antiparallel). The exchange integral $J$ arises from the combination of Coulomb repulsion and
The Pauli exclusion principle (not from magnetic dipole interactions, which are far too weak).

### 10.7 Spin Waves (Magnons)

At low temperatures ($T \ll T_C$), the reduction in magnetisation below saturation is carried by
Collective excitations called **spin waves** or **magnons**.

**Linear spin wave theory.** For a 1D chain of spins with nearest-neighbour exchange $J$ and Lattice
constant $a$The magnon dispersion is:

$$\hbar\omega(q) = 2JS[1 - \cos(qa)] = 4JS\sin^2\left(\frac{qa}{2}\right)$$

For small $q$ (long wavelength): $\hbar\omega \approx JSa^2 q^2$ (quadratic dispersion, unlike
Phonons which are linear).

The magnetisation at low $T$:

$$M(T) = M(0)\left[1 - \zeta(3/2)\left(\frac{k_B T}{4\pi JS}\right)^{3/2}\right]$$

In 3D, where $\zeta(3/2) \approx 2.612$ is the Riemann zeta function. The $T^{3/2}$ dependence
(Bloch $T^{3/2}$ law) is well confirmed experimentally and contrasts with the exponential Freeze-out
of a classical paramagnet.

Magnons are bosons and obey Bose--Einstein .../4-statistics-and-probability/2*statistics. They
contribute to the low-temperature Specific heat of ferromagnets: $C*{\mathrm{mag} \propto T^{3/2}}$.

### 10.8 The de Haas--van Alphen Effect

In a magnetic field, the electron orbits are quantised into **Landau levels**:

$$\varepsilon_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_c, \quad \omega_c = \frac{eB}{m^*}$$

The density of states oscillates with $1/B$ (de Haas--van Alphen oscillations). The oscillation
period Gives the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface:

$$\Delta\left(\frac{1}{B}\right) = \frac{2\pi e}{\hbar A_{\mathrm{ext}}}$$

This is the primary experimental technique for mapping Fermi surfaces.

:::caution Common Pitfall The exchange interaction $J$ in the Heisenberg model is _not_ the magnetic
dipole interaction. The dipole energy between two spins is $\sim \mu_0\mu_B^2/a^3 \sim 10^{-4}$ eV,
far too small to Explain Curie temperatures of $\sim 10^3$ K ($\sim 0.1$ eV). The exchange
interaction is a Consequence of the Coulomb repulsion combined with the antisymmetry of the electron
wave function (Pauli principle), and is $10$--$100$ meV.
